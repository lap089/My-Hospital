"Pregnancy gap should be at least a year - researchers","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1615B/production/_104095409_gettyimages-865499308-1.jpg"," 

Mothers should wait at least a year between giving birth and getting pregnant again to reduce health risks to mother and baby, a new study says.

But researchers say they need not wait as long as the 18 months recommended in the current World Health Organization guidelines.

Small gaps between pregnancies risk premature births, smaller babies and infant and mother mortality.

The researchers hope the findings will be ""reassuring"" for older women.

Senior study author Dr Wendy Norman said it was ""encouraging news"" for women over 35 who were planning their families.

""Older mothers for the first time have excellent evidence to guide the spacing of their children,"" she said.

""Achieving that optimal one-year interval should be doable for many women and is clearly worthwhile to reduce complication risks.""

The study, of nearly 150,000 births in Canada, by University of British Columbia (UBC) and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health is published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The study found 12-to-18 months was the ideal length of time between giving birth and becoming pregnant again.

Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend an ideal interval of 24 months and no fewer than 18 months.

The researchers also found:

Getting pregnant less than 12 months after giving birth was associated with risks for women for all ages

There were risks to the mother only for women over the age of 35, while risks to the infant were found for all women, but were greatest for those aged between 20 and 34

Women over 35 who conceived six months after a previous birth had a 1.2% risk of maternal mortality or harm (12 cases per 1,000 pregnancies)

Waiting 18 months between pregnancies reduced the risk to 0.5% (five cases per 1,000)

Younger women who got pregnant six months after a previous birth had an 8.5% risk (85 cases per 1,000) of premature labour

This dropped to 3.7% (37 per 1,000) if they waited 18 months between pregnancies

The study's lead author, Laura Schummers, said: ""Our study found increased risks to both mother and infant when pregnancies are closely spaced, including for women older than 35.

""The findings for older women are particularly important, as older women tend to more closely space their pregnancies and often do so intentionally.""

 

The study looked at only one population of women - in Canada - so it is unclear how applicable this would be worldwide.

Researcher Dr. Sonia Hernandez-Diaz said the findings suggested different risks for each age group.

""Short pregnancy spacing might reflect unplanned pregnancies, particularly among young women.

""Whether the elevated risks are due to our bodies not having time to recover if we conceive soon after delivering or to factors associated with unplanned pregnancies, like inadequate prenatal care, the recommendation might be the same: improve access to postpartum contraception, or abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse with a male partner following a birth.""

Mandy Forrester, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the study was ""useful research and builds on previous research into birth spacing"".

""Ultimately, it will be a woman's choice, whatever age they are, about how long they leave between their pregnancies. What is important is that they are aware of the evidence around birth spacing and that they make their choice armed with the right information.

""Health professionals will always support a woman in her choice, which will be about what is right for them and their pregnancy.

She said women needed access to contraceptive advice to allow them to space their births, if that was their choice, but said in specialist family planning service provision in the UK was ""patchy, with GPs frequently offering only oral contraception"".

""Specialist services should be available for all women.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:33:18 GMT"

Important information on the efficacy of new drugs and treatments is going unpublished, posing a risk to health, says a report by MPs.

The House of Commons Science and Technology Committee says despite repeated warnings, not enough is being done to make sure the results of all clinical trials are reported.

Nearly half of clinical trials go unreported, evidence suggests.

It means some clinical decisions are made without all the available data.

In some cases, this might endanger human life, says the group of MPs.

They give the example of heart drug lorcainide, which was tested in 1980.

'Publication bias'

The results showed that people who were taking it were more likely to die than those who were not, but those findings were not published until 1993 - long after it was made available to patients in the US.

The committee also heard that ""publication bias"" may have led to UK public money being wasted, for example when the government's decided to spend Â£424m to stockpile Tamiflu in response to the H1N1 ""swine flu"" epidemic in 2009.

Dr Simon Kolstoe, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth and chairman of two ethics committees, told the committee: ""Eight out of the 10 trials that were used by the company to show the drug was useful in preventing complications such as pneumonia had never actually been peer-reviewed or published.""

He said this meant governments were ""relying on a marketing spiel claiming successful trials of this drug, rather than being able to consider the actual evidence of the drug efficacy for themselves"".

The NHS Health Research Authority (HRA) has been responsible for ""promoting research transparency"" since 2014, but the committee says not enough has been done to improve reporting rates.

Public money

MPs want the HRA to produce a strategy for fixing this problem and say its performance should be measured against progress.

The HRA says it is working with the industry to promote transparency.

Committee chairman Norman Lamb said: ""Many of these trials are funded with public money and the taxpayer has a right to expect those who benefit from public funding to follow the rules and publish in full.""

He said it was particularly disappointing that trusted bodies such as Public Health England and a range of NHS Foundation Trusts were included in those failing to report results from clinical trials.

A trials tracker website, called the EU Clinical Trials Register, claims that Public Health England has three overdue trials relating to meningitis vaccination.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""We register all our trials on the EU Clinical Trials Register before they begin and are in the process of uploading our results data to it.

""We are committed to transparency and have already published this data publicly in academic journals and online at clinicaltrials.gov.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:33:07 GMT"

"Sally Hodkin murder: Patient 'called her nurse 10 times'","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16846/production/_96603229_mediaitem96603228.jpg"," PA  Sally Hodkin, seen here with her son Len Hodkin, was killed by Nicola Edgington in 2011

A patient who murdered a grandmother called her psychiatric nurse 10 times on the day of the killing and had asked to be collected, an inquest has heard.

Nicola Edgington almost decapitated Sally Hodkin with a stolen butcher's knife in Bexleyheath, in 2011, six years after killing her own mother.

Nurse Tanya Biebuyck told the inquest Edgington had left her a voicemail saying she was ""not very well"".

A recent report found NHS and police failings led to Mrs Hodkin's murder.

South London Coroner's Court heard Edgington had asked her care co-ordinator Ms Biebuyck to drop her at A&E about two weeks before the murder because she had bleeding and believed she had suffered a miscarriage.

The hearing was told the possible miscarriage may be significant as diagnosed schizophrenic Edgington had a termination against her will shortly before stabbing her mother Marion at her home in 2005.

However, Ms Biebuyck said at the time she had no concerns over her patient's mental state.

""I remember her saying to me that perhaps it was better that she wasn't pregnant because of the situation with her on-off boyfriend at that time.

""She was very relaxed, her mood was eurythmic,"" she said.

 PA  Nicola Edgington had been ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after being convicted in 2006 of killing her mother

The inquest has also heard Edgington threatened at least two people with knives while on discharge, had been smoking high-strength cannabis and had not slept in three weeks before the murder of 58-year-old Mrs Hodkin.

Ms Biebuyck said she believed the ""right decisions"" had been made with her care ""considering the clinical picture"".

She told the inquest no trace of drugs were found during random screenings of Edgington and there had also been ""no evidence of any changes in her mental health"".

On the day of Mrs Hodkin's murder, Edgington was taken to Oxleas House mental health unit, but was later allowed to walk out of the building.

"Surgery students 'losing dexterity to stitch patients'","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1D85/production/_104075570_surgery1.jpg"," 

A professor of surgery says students have spent so much time in front of screens and so little time using their hands that they have lost the dexterity for stitching or sewing up patients.

Roger Kneebone, professor of surgical education at Imperial College, London, says young people have so little experience of craft skills that they struggle with anything practical.

""It is important and an increasingly urgent issue,"" says Prof Kneebone, who warns medical students might have high academic grades but cannot cut or sew.

""It is a concern of mine and my scientific colleagues that whereas in the past you could make the assumption that students would leave school able to do certain practical things - cutting things out, making things - that is no longer the case,"" says Prof Kneebone.

Stitched up

The professor, who teaches surgery to medical students, says young people need to have a more rounded education, including creative and artistic subjects, where they learn to use their hands.

Do smartphones really affect surgeons' skills?

Prof Kneebone says he has seen a decline in the manual dexterity of students over the past decade - which he says is a problem for surgeons, who need craftsmanship as well as academic knowledge.

""An obvious example is of a surgeon needing some dexterity and skill in sewing or stitching,"" he says.




""A lot of things are reduced to swiping on a two-dimensional flat screen,"" he says, which he argues takes away the experience of handling materials and developing physical skills.

Such skills might once have been gained at school or at home, whether in cutting textiles, measuring ingredients, repairing something that's broken, learning woodwork or holding an instrument.

Students have become ""less competent and less confident"" in using their hands, he says.

""We have students who have very high exam grades but lack tactile general knowledge,"" says the professor.

Stay ahead of the robots

Prof Kneebone will be speaking on Tuesday at the V&A Museum of Childhood in east London, at the launch of a report, published by the Edge Foundation, calling for more creativity in the curriculum.

Alice Barnard, chief executive of the Edge education charity, says: ""The government pays lip service by saying creative subjects are important, but its policies demonstrate otherwise.""

She says the way school performance is measured tends to push schools to focus on core academic subjects, to the detriment of arts and creative subjects.

The report warns that entries to creative subjects have fallen by 20% since 2010, including a 57% fall in design and technology GCSE.

Tristram Hunt, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, will be speaking alongside Prof Kneebone.

""Creativity is not just for artists. Subjects like design and technology, music, art and drama are vitally important for children to develop imagination and resourcefulness, resilience, problem-solving, team-working and technical skills,"" says Mr Hunt.

""These are the skills which will enable young people to navigate the changing workplace of the future and stay ahead of the robots, not exam grades.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:34:43 GMT"

The piece advised that women with a ""jiggly belly"" should avoid wearing bikinis, and said being pear-shaped has ""often been the plague of women"".

More than 6,000 prescription and illegal drugs have been dumped in the first six weeks of an amnesty scheme in the north west.

The Public Health Agency (PHA) said the majority of drugs disposed of have been prescription medications.

Cannabis with an estimated street value of Â£4,000 has also been dumped in one of the Remove All Prescription and Illegal Drugs initiative (RAPID) bins.

The bins allow people to dispose of drugs without fear of prosecution.

Eight amnesty bins were installed in Londonderry and Strabane in mid-September.

""The Public Health Agency is pleased that the RAPID bins in the north west are providing a safe and discreet method of disposal for illegal and prescription drugs in the community"", the PHA's Denise McCallion said.

'Tragedy to individuals, families and communities'

""Drug misuse, involving both illegal and prescription drugs, is sadly a common issue and causes suffering and tragedy to individuals, families and communities,"" she added.

The RAPID scheme launched in Belfast in 2010 and there are more than 30 bins located across Northern Ireland.

More than 150,000 tablets have been disposed of since the scheme began.

Ms McCallion said the bins are placed in ""a discreet place so tablets can still be disposed of anonymously"" within communities.

The PHA said Diazepam, Pregabalin, Tramadol, Co-codamol and Codeine are among the most common drugs to have been dumped in RAPID bins.","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 09:40:57 GMT"

"Malaria: Sniffer dogs to help in fight to eradicate disease","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06q6dw7.jpg","  It's suspected that dogs are picking up on the same odours mosquitoes do

Scientists in the UK and The Gambia say they have the first evidence that dogs can sniff out malaria.

They have trained dogs to recognise tell-tale aromas using clothes from people infected with the disease.

It is hoped the animals can be used to stop malaria spreading and eventually help with eradication.

Although the research is still at an early stage, experts say the findings may even lead to new ways of testing for the disease.

Studies have already shown that being infected with the malaria parasite changes our aroma to make us more attractive to the mosquitoes that spread the disease.

Now dogs are on the scent, too.

Smelly socks

Socks worn overnight by children in the Upper River Region of The Gambia, in West Africa, were packaged and shipped to the UK.

Of the 175 pairs sent, 30 had been worn by children infected with the parasite.

The smelly footwear arrived at the Medical Detection Dogs charity in Milton Keynes.

The supremely talented noses there are already being trained to sniff out cancer and even the early stages of Parkinson's disease.

When it came to spotting malaria, the results, presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, showed dogs could pick out seven in 10 samples from infected children.

 LSHTM

But they also incorrectly thought one in 10 healthy children had malaria.

Researcher Prof Steve Lindsay, from Durham University, said he was ""really excited"" by the findings so far, but that dogs were not yet ready to be used more routinely.

The researchers still need to improve the dog's accuracy and test them on people rather than socks, as well as investigate whether the animals can sniff out different species of malaria.

The aim is to one day use specially trained dogs at airports to curb the spread of the disease and to find symptomless carriers to help eradication efforts.

Dogs could test a whole community in a short space of time.

Faster than science

Chelci Squires, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: ""Dogs are actually nature's super-smellers so it is a great gift to have them.

""They are much faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests which can take up to 20 minutes and require a fully trained professional to do.""

New tools to detect, treat and prevent malaria are needed as progress is stalling.

According to the last global report on the disease, cases had increased by five million to a new total of 216 million cases a year.

The research was a collaboration between The National Malaria Control Programme in The Gambia; the Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia; Medical Detection Dogs; Durham University; the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the University of Dundee.

"Women over 34 are being refused IVF treatment","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B55/production/_104073486_ivfstill2_e.jpg"," Charlotte, 38, is considering moving home as she is too old to qualify for IVF in her current area

Women over 34 are being automatically refused IVF treatment on the NHS in 12 areas of England, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found.

IVF should be offered to women until age 42, guidelines say, but new figures show around 80% of areas are failing to do this.

Campaign group Fertility Fairness said it ""penalises women who take longer to find a partner"".

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""blanket bans"" were ""not acceptable"".

Couples in Wales and Scotland are offered IVF until they are 42, as long as certain criteria are met.

One 38-year-old woman, Charlotte - whose surname we are not using - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she was considering moving house to a different area, having been told she was too old to qualify for the procedure in Southampton.

Southampton City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) has a cut-off age for women of 34.

""It's just unfair, because I am not over the hill,"" she said.

""To say that 35 and over is the end of having children is ridiculous.""

Charlotte was first tested aged 34, and said the ""most upsetting"" aspect was not being told about the age limit sooner.

""I would have liked to have known when I was younger,"" she said.

""It would have enabled us to make a decision earlier about selling the house, and given us another year on what is already a timed situation.""

Southampton City CCG said it had ""taken into account the relative cost-effectiveness [of IVF] compared to other treatments that could be funded with the resources we have available"".

 

Guidelines from health watchdog NICE recommend that women under 40 should be offered three full cycles of IVF, and those between 40 and 42 one full cycle.

But data from all 195 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England - obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Fertility Fairness and analysed by the Victoria Derbyshire programme - shows that seven have stopped offering IVF on the NHS entirely.

Of the others, 12 deny treatment to women over 34 - offering only one full cycle to those under that age.

85 CCGs, some 43% of the total, have cut IVF for women over 39.

England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Victoria Derbyshire such restrictions were ""not acceptable"".

""Decisions on the treatments that are made available to people should be made on their clinical need,"" he said.

""There is a reason we have guidelines in the first place - and that's to provide the standard the country should expect.""

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists blamed ""inadequate government funding"".

It said it was ""very concerned that women and their partners are turning to costly private clinics for treatment"".

  Happy Birthday IVF: Five things you might not know

Sarah Norcross, co-chair of campaign group Fertility Fairness, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that it ""penalises the women who take longer to find a partner or wish to put themselves on a secure financial footing before trying to conceive"".

The group's 2018 report into IVF rationing found that 30 CCGs have ""slashed NHS fertility services"" in the last two years.

It said many CCGs were setting their own access criteria - with 27% now using a man's body mass index (BMI) to determine whether a couple can be referred for IVF on the NHS, and 8% stipulating men must be aged below 55.

NHS England said in a statement: ""Ultimately these are decisions for local GPs, who rightly decide how best to balance the various competing demands on the NHS.""

"Are supplements safe and do they work?","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6292/production/_104043252_gettyimages-868429656.jpg"," 

The story of a man who ended up needing a liver transplant after taking green tea capsules has brought the topic of dietary supplements back into the news. What are some of the dangers of supplements and what are the health benefits?

When Jim McCants started taking green tea pills he had hoped he was giving his health a shot in the arm.

Instead, it appears the pills caused such serious damage to his liver that it required an urgent transplant.

Experts point out that experiences like that of Mr McCants, are ""extremely unusual"".

In the UK, supplements are subject to EU regulations over their safety and the health claims manufacturers make about the products.

Approved supplements bought from reputable businesses are almost always going to be safe, provided the manufacturer's instructions are followed, doctors say.

But it is wrong to assume that food supplements do not sometimes have the potential to be harmful, says Dr Wayne Carter, from the University of Nottingham.

If you take supplements in quantities above recommended levels there are risks.

While in many cases excess levels of a supplement will be excreted, there is the potential for it to be toxic, particularly to the liver, which detoxifies the substances we consume.

""I think sometimes the idea that people take on board is 'this is good for me, therefore if I take even more of it, it will be even better',"" Dr Carter says.

""This isn't without risk.""

 Jim McCants  Jim McCants needed an urgent liver transplant after taking green tea pills

There is also a potential danger in indiscriminately taking many supplements at the same time, says Dr Carter.

Sometimes they can interact with one another - that is, one supplement may strengthen the effects of another - while in other cases they might contain one or more of the same nutrients, potentially leading to excess levels.

Some of us may be less able to metabolise certain substances effectively, which can also influence how they affect us.

""The caveat with taking a supplement is it could be safe in a broad population, but not in everyone,"" Dr Carter adds.

But if these are some of the potential risks, what are the health benefits?

Supplements for child health

There are some supplements that are widely acknowledged by experts to be of benefit across the population.

The NHS recommends that women who are thinking of having a baby should have a folic acid supplement, as should any pregnant woman up to week 12 of her pregnancy, to prevent common birth defects in babies.

The government this week said it would consult on adding folic acid to flour, following repeated calls for the move from experts.

Vitamin D supplements are also recommended in babies, children between the ages of one and four, and people who are not often exposed to the sun.

This includes those who are frail or housebound or usually wear clothes that cover up most of their skin when outdoors.

The rest of the population is advised to consider taking a Vitamin D supplement.

   The NHS says most people can get all of the vitamins and minerals they need from a balanced diet

A lack of vitamin D, which we mostly get from the sun, can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults.

Dr Benjamin Jacobs, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, said: ""A hundred years ago most children in London had rickets. That was basically abolished by the practice of giving children a vitamin supplement.""

An injection of vitamin K is also offered to babies within the first 24 hours of their life to prevent a rare but serious blood disorder.

'Constantly evolving science'

Dr Jacobs said supplements are also important for people with either restricted diets or allergies.

For example, the NHS says vegans might need a vitamin B12 supplement, because it is only found naturally in foods from animal sources.

However, in many other supplements the evidence of there being a benefit for most people is less clear.

For example, the NHS says that most people do not need to take other vitamin supplements and can get all the vitamins and minerals they need, apart from vitamin D, from a balanced diet.

The benefits of fish oil pills, a supplement linked to a wide range of purported benefits, from improved heart health to boosted brain power, are also not conclusive.

A recent review of scientific trials found the evidence that fish oil pills protect the heart was flimsy at best.

Sam Jennings, a director of Berry Ottaway & Associates Ltd, a consultancy that works with supplement manufacturers, said nutrition was a ""constantly evolving science, there is always new data emerging"".

She added: ""What has become clear is that with supplements the benefits aren't always going to be obvious in all people, because it's going to depend on that individual's own make-up as to whether they will receive benefit from having an extra nutrient of some kind.""

Dr Carter said his own advice would be for people to look at what kind of scientific evidence there was in support of a particular supplement before taking it and check whether there are any warnings.

Tips for taking supplements

Buy supplements from reputable suppliers - they should have gone through rigorous quality assurance

Check if they have been tested in clinical trials with a cohort of people that is similar to them (comparable age, sex)

Look for warnings - for example, people with heart conditions would want to check the supplement is not toxic for the heart

Be cautious about taking multiple supplements at the same time

Stick within recommended doses

The number of students seeking mental health support while studying at university has increased by more than 50% in five years, analysis suggests.

The BBC asked universities across the UK for the numbers of students seeking some form of support.

The National Union of Students said young people were under increasing pressure to perform

The Department for Education said universities needed to provide pastoral care for students.

In August, a pre-inquest hearing into the death of a vulnerable student at Bristol University heard she did not receive well-being support. Natasha Abrahart, 20, is one of 11 students at the university to die since October 2016.

The university later issued a statement, saying it had made offers of support towards Ms Abrahart.

'There's a lot of shame attached'

  Mental health at university: Stress made me anxious

Christian Frank, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""Universities are just accepted by students to be a hotbed for stress and anxiety. The drinking culture at university allowed me to hide away, numbing my pain and normalising being exhausted in the day and hyperactive at night.

""I'd been ill throughout the course and talked to the extenuating circumstances officer about how many lectures I'd missed but my anxiety was too high to admit that I had a problem.

""By admitting to someone at the university, I'm telling them that I feel like I'm not good enough to finish a course I signed up for. This means there's a lot of shame attached to asking for help.""

'Seeking help was not made easy'

 Will said he started positively but found it tough being away

Will had gone to university feeling ""quite positive"" but found his mental health deteriorated during the first term.

He admitted things had been tough, being away from his family, and because he had not immediately ""found his feet"" by joining societies and making friends.

Will said the idea of seeking help with mental health issues was not easy.

""On the university mental health counselling website there is a form you fill out that ranks your answers from not at all to very likely - there are a lot of very triggering questions.

""[But it] felt like almost immediately you opened it there's less of a chance you are going to get in because there will be people filling it in as 'likely' for every single thing.""

Two months after completing the form he was emailed to say he had not been accepted for one-on-one counselling.

""I'm feeling better now but was definitely in a worse place after the experience of not getting help,"" he said.

""It's something the uni needs to focus on... and make more personal.""

'He could very easily have been another'

Kayleigh, from the University of Bristol, said: ""A friend of mine was suicidal at uni. We got him referred to the university counselling service but he was on a long waiting list. They suggested he talk to a tutor and maybe if he'd done that he would have got counselling sooner but he was so stressed about the course that he didn't want to. It was really hard to get anyone to take any notice.

""One night he was threatening suicide, I took him to A&E and they sent him home. I didn't know what to do so my mum sent the vice chancellor a very angry email, basically saying, if he dies, it's on your hands. The next day, uni mental health services got in touch and referred him to an emergency external counselling service.

""He ended up dropping out and is much healthier and happier but the uni really should have dealt with it better. Especially since Bristol is in the news about high suicide rates - he could very easily have been another.""

Of 83 universities that provided five years of full data from 2012 to 2017, the number of students seeking help rose from 50,900 to 78,100. The number of students going to university dropped slightly over the same period.

At the same time, budgets towards mental health services increased by more than 40%.

Eva Crossan Jory, the NUS Vice President, said: ""There is a growth in demand [for mental health services] over the last decade, in part, because the reality of studying in the UK has changed so much.

""Many are balancing work, study and caring responsibilities. With fees so high, and the job market so competitive, students feel they have to continually push themselves, perhaps more so than before.""

Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""University is supposed to be an assault on the senses. It should be demanding and disorientating, and with that should come adequate pastoral care for studentsâ.

""This does not mean mollycoddling or cushioning students from the experiences that are part and parcel of university life, it means making sure support services are available if they need them.""

A University of Bristol spokesperson said it had adopted a university-wide approach to identify vulnerable students as early as possible and get them the right support.

"Opt-out organ donation plan wins Commons backing","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/87F4/production/_100040843_225ad563-e589-4206-b7c9-73309257bcbc.jpg"," NHS BLOOD AND TRANSPLANT

Hundreds of lives could be saved each year under a new opt-out system for organ donation approved by MPs.

Under the plans, passed by the Commons, adults in England will be presumed to be donors unless they have specifically recorded their decision not to be.

A high-profile media campaign to change the law was inspired by the case of 10-year-old Max Johnson, who was saved by a heart transplant.

If passed by the Lords, the measures would come into effect in spring 2020.

More than 5,000 people are currently waiting for an organ transplant and ministers estimate that the change in the law would save up to 700 lives each year.

The Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill, which has cross-party support and the backing of government, passed its last hurdle in the Commons on Friday.

The private member's bill was tabled by Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson, who was not present in the Commons chamber due to illness.

Speaking on his behalf, Labour's Dan Jarvis said the switch to an opt-out system would add thousands of names to the donor register but people should not be ""shamed"" into consenting.

""This is not about the state taking control of people's organs,"" he said.

""If people do want to opt out that is absolutely fine and I am entirely respectful of any decision of any one for whatever reason so to do, no questions will be asked and there will be no hard feelings.""

The government has said it wants to encourage people to discuss, with their families, the issue of whether they would want to be a donor in the event of their death.

But under the bill's ""soft opt-out"" proposals, the wishes of families and next of kin would continue to be respected, so removal of organs would not go ahead without their support.

There would be exemptions for under-18s and adults not able to make informed decisions. The timetable for its introduction would allow for a year of ""transition"" to the new law.

In Wales, where an opt-out system was introduced in December 2015, there was a small dip in the number of deceased donors, from 64 in 2015-16 to 61 in 2016-17.","Fri, 26 Oct 2018 16:16:19 GMT"

"Plymouth hospital in 'pioneering' deal with private health company","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F110/production/_101221716_gettyimages-97768287-1.jpg"," 

A row has broken out over a deal which will see NHS surgeons carrying out operations in a private hospital.

It covers all non-urgent orthopaedic surgery at Derriford Hospital, part of University Hospitals Plymouth Trust.

A spokesperson for the trust said it was an ""innovative"" and ""pioneering"" partnership which would reduce waiting times for patients.

But Labour said it looked like ""front door privatisation.""

The deal, over a period of a year-and-a-half and involving about 200 cases a month, is said to be the first of its kind between an NHS trust and a private provider.

NHS patients are already able to ask to have an operation at a private hospital and in the past there have been initiatives to reduce NHS waiting lists by paying independent providers to carry out operations.

But this deal will involve NHS consultants and other staff in Plymouth carrying out orthopaedic surgery in a local hospital, Peninsula Treatment Centre, which is run by the private group Care UK.

The trust argues that the move will reduce waiting times for less urgent operations by freeing up operating theatre capacity and virtually eliminate waits of more than a year.

'Innovative'

Ann James, chief executive of University Hospitals Plymouth, said: ""Winter is always a challenging time for the NHS and we are constantly looking at innovative ways to address patient demand.

""Using a trusted independent health provider to create additional capacity at times of high demand ensures that patients are not kept waiting longer than they have to, often in pain.

""With the existing treatment centre less than a mile away, Care UK is uniquely placed to provide the service and the only difference that patients should really notice is that they are now being seen more quickly.""

 Derriford Hospital is part of University Hospitals Plymouth Trust

Last winter, thousands of routine operations were cancelled across the NHS as hospitals were urged to free up beds and theatre capacity for emergency cases.

The Plymouth Trust acknowledges that the new arrangement with Care UK is part of its preparations for the coming winter.

Last time, the hospital had to temporarily convert a planned orthopaedic ward to try to cope with the increase in medical patients.

'Fat cats'

But Labour's Jon Ashworth said: ""This is an unprecedented move that looks like a front door privatisation.

""The fact this hospital feels it has no option but to turn to private sector providers to try to bring waiting lists down and to free up space for winter, blows apart Tory claims that austerity has ended.""

Two Plymouth MPs have clashed over the announcement.

Labour's Luke Pollard tweeted: ""Fat cat private healthcare companies should not be running the NHS and this decision shows just how severe the NHS crisis is locally.

""I will fight privatisation of our NHS all the way.""

But the Conservative Johnny Mercer told the Plymouth Live news website: ""One day local Labour politician wannabes will leave their ideology at the door and actually try and deliver something that improves the lives of Plymothians across our city.

""The move simply means patients receive a better level of service.""","Fri, 26 Oct 2018 15:47:55 GMT"

"Could height be a cancer risk?","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5B97/production/_103974432_tallmangetty.jpg"," 

Taller people are at more risk of getting cancer, a new study looking at over a million people claims.

Past reports have reached the same conclusion, but should lofty people be alarmed, or is this just a tall story?

Experts stress the results only point to a very small increase in risk compared with factors like smoking.

Plus it is unclear what might be the driver behind the link. The leading theory is tall people have more cells that can turn cancerous.

But hormone levels, other illnesses and how affluent or deprived people are when young, might have an impact on height and cancer risk too.

Report author Dr Leonard Nunney told the BBC a person's risk factor depended on their exact height.

""If 50/500 average height women got cancer then 60/500 tall (178cm) women would be expected to get cancer. If you consider a very tall woman, say 6'2"" (188cm), then you'd expect 67/500.""

He added: ""The effect of smoking is massive. Even a light smoker (about three per day) has a huge six times increase in lung cancer risk ie: 50/500 becomes 300/500.""

What did the study say?

The report, published by the Royal Society, says that for every 4in (10cm) increase in human height above the average used in the study of 5ft 7in for men and 5ft 3in for women, there is a 10% greater risk of that person getting cancer.

The data was compiled from four large-scale studies, including the Million Women Study, on 23 cancer types in the UK, US, South Korea, Austria, Norway and Sweden.

Each study chosen had to include 10,000 cancer cases for each sex.

Of 18 cancer types analysed in both men and women, four - pancreas, oesophagus, stomach and mouth/pharynx - showed no apparent increase with height.

And in the sex-specific cancers, only one - cervix - was unaffected.

What do experts think?

Height is only one of many factors that determine a person's cancer risk and it's definitely not a big one. Plus it can't be modified, unlike lifestyle risk factors, such as body weight.

Experts say that the key to increasing chances of avoiding illness is living a healthy lifestyle.

Georgina Hill, from Cancer Research UK, told the BBC: ""The increased risk is small and there's plenty you can do to reduce the risk of developing cancer such as not smoking and keeping a healthy weight.""

Dr John O'Neill, research group leader, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), said: ""If you have more cells, you have a greater risk of cancer. Tall people have a greater surface area, and therefore more melanocytes, and so of course they're more likely to get melanoma.""

Prof Andrew Sharrocks, professor of molecular biology, University of Manchester, said: ""Extrapolating from a height correlation to increased cell number being the reason for higher cancer incidence is a big leap and is only one possible explanation.

""Similarly, saying that the higher incidence is due to a higher proliferation rate is also dubious, given the fact that most cancers arise much later in life, long after the increased proliferation associated with enhanced growth during childhood and adolescence has ceased.""

What about the benefits?

This report follows on from a 2011 one from the University of Oxford and a similar study in Sweden in 2015.

Prof Tim Cole, a professor of medical statistics at University College London, said tall people should not be too worried about any of the findings.

""Being tall has quite a lot of benefits, so having one minus factor is not too disastrous,"" he told the BBC.

""There are actually lots of status benefits for tall people. People who earn more money tend to be taller and world leaders tend to be taller, so things stack up in their favour.""

 AFP  US President Donald Trump (left) and Canada's Justin Trudeau are each around 6ft 2in tall

What do tall people think of the findings?

Stuart Logan, a director of the UK's Tall Persons Club, feels that researchers tackle their studies in the wrong way.

His club, which was founded in 1991, has around 250 members in the UK and Ireland, as well as some in other European countries.

""We've noticed that a lot of men are averaging around 6ft 3in or 6ft 4in and women around 5ft 10in or 5ft 11in,"" Mr Logan told the BBC.

""So it would be more useful if researchers contacted different associations like ourselves and used our members to produce their reports.

""Reports like this are unhelpful - they may produce better headlines but those are not backed up by the data included.

""What slightly annoys me is that on the positive side, the taller you are the less chance you have of diabetes, stroke or heart disease - but then you are told you have more risk of getting cancer.""","Wed, 24 Oct 2018 14:47:07 GMT"

Winter is coming.

No, really. IT IS COMING.

You may have forgotten cold weather is even a thing as Britain basks in the glow of a particularly mild autumn.

But the annual descent into winter is due - temperatures will plummet as low as 1C this weekend.

To add to the shock the clocks go back on Saturday night, so it's going to get even darker in the evenings.

Whether you love or loathe winter, here are some tips to keep you happy and healthy.

How can I prepare my mind?

Feeling gloomier in winter isn't unusual for many of us - but for a small minority there could be a biological cause.

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is clinical depression brought on by the changing seasons.

Research is yet to provide conclusive results on its how it works, but there are a number of theories based around a lack of sunlight disrupting our sleep cycles.

 PA  Shorter days means less sunlight during the winter months

Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, explains it could be related to ""the natural phenomenon of hibernation"", as well as the hormone melatonin.

Methods of coping, he adds, include the use of a light box (to mimic sunlight) and regular visits to sunnier countries.

The NHS recommends light boxes, saying 30 minutes to an hour per day should be enough to make a difference.

But helping your mood isn't just about the weather - improving your lifestyle through healthy eating and exercise will also help.

How can I prepare my body?

Healthy eating and exercise could also stave off illnesses associated with the winter months.

The NHS advises that regular consumption of fruit, vegetables, milk and yoghurt - dairy products contain protein, vitamins A and B12, and calcium - will help to boost your immune system.

Winter vegetables - carrots, parsnips, swede, turnips - are perfect either for roasting, mashing or making soup.

Eating hearty breakfasts containing fibre and starchy foods like cereal will also keep illness at bay, as will regular exercise.

To keep ""winter tiredness"" at bay, the NHS suggests getting ""outdoors in natural daylight as much as possible"" as well as counteracting stress with meditation.

  How to keep warm? Tips from cold countries

How can I help others during the colder months?

For some in the UK the weather poses a serious threat.

At least 449 homeless people are reported to have died in the UK during the last 12 months, some as the result of freezing conditions.

Here are a few ways you can help:

Homelessness charity Shelter suggests using a hot drink or some food as a conversation starter to see ""what other type of support the person may need""

If you're worried about a homeless person, StreetLink provides a platform for anyone to refer them to local support services

Homeless Link, meanwhile, provides a directory of day centres that offer food, showers, laundry and shelter from the cold

Here are five more practical ways you can help someone who's homeless

At home, the NHS advises temperatures are kept at a minimum of 18C during the winter - especially if people are immobile, over the age of 65 or have a health condition.

If you know someone who struggles with the costs of heating their home, alert them to grants of up to Â£300 in the form of either the Winter Fuel Payment or the Cold Weather Payment.

People can also seek advice on insulating their homes from the Energy Savings Trust.

...there is much to embrace

 

Despite the darker nights, there's plenty to look forward to in the months ahead.

For those prepared to brave the outdoors, skiing in the Cairngorms, ice climbing in Kinlochleven, ice skating at Somerset House or even curling in Tunbridge Wells is available.

Many, though, will (unsurprisingly) prefer to spend their free time out of the cold.

 

Need inspiration for how to spend that time?

In Denmark, the concept of ""hygge"" (pronounced ""hoo-gah"") means perfecting the art of creating a warm atmosphere or cosiness through experiences.

 PA

Hygge is a ""fundamental"" aspect of your approach to life, explains Danish anthropologist Jeppe Trolle Linnet - and he says it fits well with how we view winter.

""The essence of it is how people relate to each other,"" he explains.

""Pay attention to each other, give each other quality time, relax together and leave some of the discipline of work and fitness aside.""

Leave fitness aside? No problem.

 

So for those looking for their own ""hygge"" in the coming months, fire-side evenings in old pubs, carol singing with friends and spiced hot drinks are fine - as is any activity, for that matter - as long as you're doing it with the people you love.

Can't be bothered to socialise?

Following the theme of Nordic lifestyle trends, why not try pÃ¤ntsdrunk?

PÃ¤ntsdrunk is the anglicised word for the Finnish term ""kalsarikÃ¤nni"", which literally means ""drinking at home, alone, in your underwear"".

This is more than a niche pastime in Finland.

It's become such a well-established part of the country's culture that its ministry of foreign affairs even talks about it in its guide to the country.

Finnish writer Miska Rantanen says the concept was born as a way of coping with long, dark winters when people couldn't be bothered to face the cold outside in order to see friends - so got drunk at home instead.

"NHS funding: Is the boost worth Â£84bn or Â£20bn?","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11740/production/_102088417_surgeonsgetty.jpg"," 

Back in the summer, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that NHS England's budget would increase by Â£20.5bn by 2023. This was confirmed in Philip Hammond's Budget but, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the chancellor said the NHS was getting an Â£84bn boost.

""Don't forget we already made another promise back in June... to put Â£84bn into our National Health Service,"" he told the BBC.

So which is it: Â£20.5bn or Â£84bn?

Well the answer - somewhat confusingly - is that both figures refer to the same thing, but they are based on different calculations.

Let's start with the Â£20.5bn figure

The figure of Â£20.5bn is simply the difference between this year's NHS England budget and what the government says it will be in 2024 once inflation is taken into account - as shown in the government's NHS funding document published in June.

This works out as a 3.4% a year increase, on average, over the next five years.

But what about the Â£84bn figure?

The chancellor, on the other hand, has taken each annual increase and added it up year by year to arrive at a much larger figure (ie it's cumulative).

But that alone doesn't get you to Â£84bn.

He's also included the extra funding settlements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as part of the Barnett formula.

The Barnett formula is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive when funding is increased in areas such as health and education in England.

Furthermore, the chancellor has also included an increase in NHS pension funding (worth up Â£1.2bn a year from 2019) in his calculations.

By putting all the extra numbers together, you get a table like this:

 Source: Budget 2018

Adding up all the additional NHS annual spend over the next five years gets you to the cumulative Â£84bn figure cited by the chancellor (or Â£83.58bn to be precise).

This is confirmed in the main Budget document, known as the red book:

""Â£20.5bn more a year in real terms by 2023-24... with a total UK-wide scorecard cost of Â£83.6bn.""

But some argue the Treasury's method is not a typical accounting procedure, among them is David Maguire, policy analyst, at the King's Fund think tank:

""Normally you take the starting point and compare it with the end point,"" he says.

""And to have different numbers (Â£20.5bn and Â£84bn), it makes it harder for the public to understand what's happening.""

The Treasury disagrees. It says the Â£84bn figure is clearly set out in the Budget scorecard and it stresses that both figures are correct.

"Reality Check: Is Scottish A&E outperforming England?","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/168F7/production/_103770429_freeman_quote-nc.png","The claim: Scottish NHS accident and emergency departments have performed better than English ones for the last three and a half years.

Reality Check verdict: A higher proportion of patients has indeed been admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours in Scotland than in England for the last three and a half years. Scottish A&E departments have still been missing their 95% target in this area for more than a year.

Jeane Freeman, cabinet secretary for health and sport, told the SNP conference on Monday that Scottish A&E departments have been doing better than their English counterparts.

You have to be a bit careful comparing statistics between the nations of the UK.

Earlier this year, Theresa May got into trouble with from the UK Statistics Authority, which ensures the correct use of official numbers, for comparing 12-hour A&E waiting times in Wales and England.

The UKSA said: ""Waiting time comparisons between UK countries are difficult for a variety of reasons, including differences in data collection and in health service structure - the use of walk-in centres for example.""

The comparison is also tricky because there is greater demand for A&E services in England than in Scotland. In 2017-18, the former had 27,639 visits per 100,000 population, while Scotland had 24,929.

NHS Digital says the best comparison to make is between Type 1, major A&E facilities in England (in order to exclude things like walk-in centres and minor injury units) and emergency departments in Scotland.

Looking at this measure, the last time England had better four-hour A&E waiting times was in February 2015 - three and a half years ago.

NHS England and NHS Scotland both have a target that 95% of people visiting A&E will be discharged, admitted or transferred within four hours.

The last time NHS England met that target was in July 2013. NHS Scotland has been performing better, but has not hit the target since July 2017.

NHS Digital acknowledges that these statistics don't fully account for the ""differing case mix of patients"", for example, the age profile of an area or the provision of other forms of care.

"How can you get enough iron from your diet?","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/82D9/production/_103379433_iron.jpg","   Red meat, green veg, nuts and seeds are all good dietary sources of iron

Do you often feel tired, short of breath or can you feel you heart beating away inside your chest? Have your friends commented that you look unusually pale?

If so, you may have iron-deficiency anaemia, the world's most common nutritional disorder.

In the UK, it is particularly common among young women.

An analysis by the government's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) on iron and health in 2011 indicated 21% of women aged between 19 and 34 had below recommended levels of ferritin (how iron is stored in the body).

I recently suggested to a friend with these symptoms that she might want to get herself checked out by her GP. A blood test revealed she was so anaemic it was surprising she could still walk upstairs. A few iron tablets sorted her out.

It's worth adding that you should talk to your GP if you're considering taking them - you might not need them and your symptoms could be caused by something else.

Where can you get your iron from?

Our bodies can't produce iron, so you have to get it in your diet - whether through foods that naturally contain it or those that have been fortified with iron, such as white bread and breakfast cereal.

The problem is that not all of that iron is in a form you can actually absorb.

 Glenn Dearing

How to get the most iron from your food

Eat leafy green veg raw or steamed

But do lightly boil your spinach

Eat or drink something containing vitamin C with your meal

Fermented breads are best

Trust Me I'm a Doctor asked nutrition scientist Prof Paul Sharp, from King's College London, to find the foods you should be eating to boost iron levels naturally.

Red meat is particularly rich in the sort of iron bodies find easy to absorb but these days many people are either cutting back on their red-meat consumption or cutting it out altogether.

And there are good sources of iron in dark-green leafy vegetables, such as kale and spinach, and pulses, such as peas and lentils. The problem is you don't absorb as much iron from plant sources as you do from red meat.

Then, there is the iron you can get from fortified bread and breakfast cereals, though again it is not always in a very absorbable form.

To demonstrate this, a neat party trick is to grind up the cereal, add some warm water and you can actually use a magnet to draw the iron filings out of the mush.

Wait for your coffee...

How you prepare your food and what you drink with it can also change how much iron you absorb.

To demonstrate this, Prof Sharp carried out some experiments to mimic human digestion.

The tests mimicked the effect of the enzymes involved in digesting food and the chemical reaction that occurs in human gut cells to show how much iron would be absorbed.

Take the test: Could eating more iron stop you feeling tired?

Prof Sharp showed that if you drink orange juice with your fortified breakfast cereal you absorb much more iron than when eating the cereal on its own - because orange juice contains vitamin C, which makes it easier to absorb iron from food.

But, disappointingly, if you drink coffee with your morning bowl of cereal, then that will mean you absorb significantly less iron.

   Raw cabbage anyone?

Why? Well, according to Prof Sharp, it's because coffee is full of chemicals called polyphenols that are very efficient at binding to the iron and making that iron less soluble.

So, if a fortified cereal is your breakfast of choice, then having a small glass of orange juice or an orange will help increase your iron uptake. You might also want to consider postponing your morning coffee until at least 30 minutes after you've eaten.

But what if you prefer getting your iron from more natural sources? Raw cabbage is a good source of available iron but we found that steaming it lessened the amount of available iron while boiling reduced it even further.

That's because, like oranges, cabbage is rich in vitamin C - and when you boil it, the vitamin C is released into the cooking water.

So, if you want to get the maximum nutrients from your cabbage, eat it raw (an acquired taste) or steam it.

The same is true of other veggies that contain both iron and vitamin C, such as kale, broccoli, cauliflower and watercress.

But, strangely enough, spinach is completely different. We found that when we boiled the spinach, it actually released 55% more ""bioavailable"" iron than when eaten raw.

Prof Sharp says: ""Spinach has compounds, called oxalates, and they basically trap the iron.

""When we cook spinach, the oxalate is released into the cooking water, and therefore the iron that remains will be more available for absorption.""

Finally, what about the bread?

We found the best bread for delivering iron was sourdough bread. That's because wheat contains a chemical called phytic acid that slows down iron absorption by the body.

When sourdough bread is made, the fermentation process breaks down the phytic acid so the iron that remains is more available for absorption.

"Making Australia care about 'silent epidemic'","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AF99/production/_103035944_endo.jpg"," Syl Freedman  Lesley (L) and Syl Freedman's petition for a medication drew a massive response

Australia recently launched its first ""national action plan"" targeting endometriosis. It followed the advocacy of many - not least a mother and daughter who used viral success to fuel a wider conversation, writes Gary Nunn in Sydney.

Earlier this year, Sylvia Freedman received a message from a woman she'd never met disclosing something she found ""bizarre, but lovely!""

The woman had decided to name her baby Sylvia, because without Sylvia's advocacy, she'd never have got pregnant.

Syl suffers from endometriosis. Endometriosis (endo) currently has no known cause and no cure. It can cause severe pelvic pain and infertility.

Back in 2013, Syl's university tutor, who also had endo, offered to mentor her through an honours thesis on coverage of endometriosis in the media.

Their web search for media mentions of endometriosis returned zero mentions of the disease in any major Australian media outlets over 10 years. The tutor withdrew her offer, saying Syl couldn't do a literature review with nothing to review.

It was a fresh blow after a decade of confusion, debilitating pain, missed classes, losing jobs and endless hours on the couch hugging a hot water bottle, wishing she lived inside a different body.

Lobbying a pharma giant

Today, Sylvia, 27, is having a good day. She's able to sit upright on a chair opposite me and her mum, Lesley at their home in Sydney.

In the past, endo often left her unable to sit up, walk or even do up her jeans. Syl feels much better now partly thanks to effective excision surgery, daily self-management and Visanne - a drug designed to treat endo.

This medication is now available in Australia because Lesley and Sylvia took on pharmaceutical giant Bayer - and won.

 Syl Freedman  Syl Freedman is now on a committee advising the Australian government

Lesley discovered that Visanne was having success in treating endo-related pain overseas, but Bayer would not bring it to Australia and New Zealand. ""The marketing manager said I'd need to convince them there's a market for it here,"" she says.

Lesley started emailing her friends, but Syl thought there had to be a quicker way. She shared her story on Change.org, asking people to sign their petition targeting Bayer. The signatures would prove the need.

In total, they got 74,064 signers. Though the medication does not work for everyone, the pair were thrilled. Lesley wrote to supporters online: ""Together, we've changed the mind of one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies.""

From there they founded their own not-for-profit, EndoActive, which raises awareness, provides evidence-based information and advocates on behalf of the 700,000 women and girls with endo in Australia.

They convened Australia's first patient-centred endometriosis conference in 2015. ""Women were in tears before they even walked through the doors, relieved they were finally being taken seriously,"" Lesley says. ""Many women are not believed or told painful periods are normal.""

  Me and my endometriosis: 12 women share their stories

This awareness, along with work by others, helped bring about Australia's first National Action Plan for Endometriosis, launched last month.

""[Endo] is a silent epidemic, hidden due to stigma, misunderstanding, and society's easy dismissal of the importance and severity of pain in women,"" says Dr Susan Evans, a gynaecologist who is chair of the Pelvic Pain Foundation of Australia.

""Syl and Lesley have presented the story of girls and women in pain in a way that Australians appreciate, understand, and relate to. They've built on the work by women, advocates and consumers over many years to dramatically raise the profile of the condition.""

'Insane' toll

It's estimated that one in 10 women have endo. It occurs when tissue similar to the womb lining grows outside it in other parts of the body (from reproductive organs up to the brain), in some cases strangling and gluing together other organs, causing excruciating pain.

It takes, on average, seven to 12 years to get diagnosed. Symptoms vary but can be devastating: many experience crippling pelvic pain, 30% have fertility problems, and 66% experience pain during sex.

Syl would often turn up to work then vomit violently straight away. She was constantly fatigued. Two surgeries took months to recover from.

""Endo symptoms are so weird and so random you feel like you're going insane,"" she says. ""I still get anxious that people think I'm faking it.""

The problem is, endo is an invisible illness. ""The other day I had conjunctivitis"" Syl says. ""Everyone was saying 'you poor thing'. I thought, this is nothing! If only endo was this obvious.""

 Syl Freedman  Syl says she was left feeling desperate after receiving poor medical advice

Women have had to face such challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of endo, that Health Minister Greg Hunt made a national apology in December to recognise the pain and problems they've encountered in receiving adequate medical advice and treatment.

""Hearing that was so moving,"" Syl says.

Mr Hunt recently made a A$4.7m (Â£2.7m; $3.4m) commitment to the National Action Plan for Endometriosis and Syl now sits on the steering committee. Their first meeting will have many action points but debunking myths is high on Syl's list.

""Like so many women, I was told by a doctor that getting pregnant would help my pain,"" she says. ""I was 21, in agony and without a partner. I asked my best friend, who's gay, if he'd consider having a baby with me. Mum considered recruiting her friend's son. I'd never even met him. That's how desperate we were.

""Now we know pregnancy isn't a cure. We need to re-educate doctors as well as patients.""

Dr Evans says: ""Throughout the world, endometriosis and pelvic pain are under-recognised, under-researched, under-managed and under-supported. There's vast unmet human need in this area and change has been slow.""","Tue, 28 Aug 2018 15:05:30 GMT"

"Cruise ship rescue: How to survive for 10 hours in the water","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06hwwf1.jpg","  'I am very lucky to be alive'

A British woman has survived for 10 hours in the sea off the coast of Croatia after falling from the back of a cruise ship.

The 46-year-old was alone and 60 miles from shore when she was rescued and taken to hospital. Details of her remarkable survival are still emerging - but what could help you stay alive in a similar situation?

Water temperature

There were several lucky factors in this case which helped the survivor, Kay Longstaff.

Sea survival instructor Simon Jinks says she could have sunk three or four metres beneath the water's surface after the initial fall and was fortunate not to be pulled under the ship.

There can be turbulence in the water next to a cruise liner and ""some waves can push you away and some waves can take you in"", he said - but it depends on the speed of the ship as well as luck.

She was also probably ""winded"" by the fall from such a large vessel.

Her second stroke of the luck was the warmth of the water she fell into - estimated to have been about 28-29C, or ""a little bit warmer than a swimming pool"", says Professor Mike Tipton, an expert on surviving extreme environments.

A person can survive for around one hour in 5C water, two hours in 10C and six hours in 15C - but if the temperature is in the high 20s then it is possible to survive for around 25 hours, he says.

Humans can go into cold water shock if the temperature is too low, which means they lose the ability to control their breathing and can potentially inhale water or drown.

And as their body temperature falls, someone can become tired, confused or disorientated.

If she'd fallen into the sea around Britain, she'd have been in water of between 12C and 15C - cool enough to cause cold water shock.

Try to float

According to this guide on Personal Survival Techniques, produced for the Irish sea fisheries board, the best way to slow down the rate at which your body cools is to avoid swimming and instead try to float in the water with your knees raised up to your chest.

The ""flat, calm conditions"" meant the woman in this case was able to float, swim and ""stay pretty much where she fell in"", says Prof Tipton.

""She wasn't being battered by waves for the whole of the time. She would have most inevitably had drowned if that had been the case.""

  Watch BBC reporter Natalie Crockett try out the RNLI floating technique

Clothing and footwear improve a person's buoyancy during their first moments in the water because they trap air, according to the RNLI. Floating calmly rather than moving around a lot will help the air stay trapped.

Anything you can do to help you float will improve your chances.

This maritime training school on Australia's Sunshine Coast advises anyone who finds themselves stuck in the water to look for something that is floating and hold on to it.

If they do not have a life jacket, they should try to make buoyancy out of clothing - a move familiar to many in the UK from school swimming lessons.

Get found

With the time it's possible to survive in the water limited, it's important to get rescued as soon as possible.

In this case, people on board appear to have noticed the woman was missing and used the ship's CCTV to pinpoint the time of her fall and hence her probable location.

But, as Prof Tipton says, it's still very hard to find someone floating alone at sea - particularly at night. ""It's just a really difficult thing to find what essentially is a head in the water.""

Be female

Women's high proportion of body fat - typically 10% more than men - can work in their favour.

""They have more subcutaneous fat and that means they are more buoyant because the body's buoyancy comes primarily from the air and fat in the body,"" Prof Tipton told BBC 5 Live.

The extra fat also helps keep the body warm, which helps when the human body gets tired in the water.

""You can imagine if you have to swim for 10 hours to keep your airway clear of the water, there's a pretty good chance you'd get exhausted,"" he said.

How do you survive 66 days lost at sea?

Incredible stories of survival at sea

Floating urged to increase sea survival

Keep your head

In order to survive this kind of ordeal, you also need to be mentally resilient.

According to Survival Psychology by Dr John Leach, during disaster situations, most people will be paralysed into doing nothing to help themselves. Others will panic but some will immediately take active measures to survive.

""I think there is a big psychological aspect,"" said Professor Tipton. ""At the time, hours six, seven, eight and nine it must be a fairly desperate situation to be in.""

 Norwegian Cruise Line  The British woman was found around one mile from where she fell from the Norwegian Star

In this case, the woman reportedly told a rescuer that she sang overnight to stop her getting cold.

Mr Jinks, whose company, Sea Regs, trains boat skippers and crews, says a person's ""will to survive"" is crucial. ""If you go into a situation and think, 'I'm going to die,' your psychology changes,"" he said.

Conversely, making a decision to tell yourself ""I'm not going to die today"" can help your chances.

What about the effect of alcohol?

The RNLI says around one in eight coastal deaths in the UK involves alcohol and urges swimmers to avoid going into the water after a drink.

It warns that alcohol can seriously impair judgement, reactions and ability to swim.

But Prof Tipton said in one of his recent studies, volunteers consumed six vodka drinks before going into the water.

And he said alcohol ""made absolutely no difference to their physiological responses to immersion"".

""What it does do is it makes your decision making a little more difficult. People make bad decisions when they've got alcohol on board.""

There is no indication that alcohol was involved in this most recent case.

Medical students are losing the dexterity to stitch up their patients because they are spending too much time in front of screens.

That's the claim from one professor of surgery who says trainee doctors are ""less competent"", compared to their older colleagues, at using their hands.

Professor Roger Kneebone, from Imperial College London, says young people have so little experience of craft skills that they struggle with practical tasks.

It's a worrying thought - but how true is it? Does screen time impact dexterity?

Professor Kneebone argues that a decline in the manual dexterity of medical students is due to a lack of experience in handling materials, and that ""a lot of things are reduced to swiping on a two-dimensional flat screen"".

But his view is being challenged by doctors and health professionals, who say the facts, and their personal experiences, don't back him up.

Physiotherapist Ashley James said there is ""very, very little evidence"" to suggest the widespread use of smartphones by students affects their manual dexterity.

""There's not that research out there,"" he said. ""I'm not saying he [Professor Kneebone] doesn't have a point, but the likelihood is the authority and certainty of which he speaks is probably not based on fact or any evidence.""

Mr James pointed to a study of 100 medical students, half of whom were frequent mobile phone texters, and half light users.

""The researchers didn't find anything different in terms of dexterity,"" says Mr James. ""But another thing they tested in that study was reaction time.

""Mobile phone frequent texters had improved reaction time.""

He added: ""It's just one small study. I wouldn't hang my hat on it but I wouldn't be as forthright on my conclusion as the surgeon is.""

'Video games boosted my dexterity'

Trainee surgeon Saied Froghi, from London, who played video games like Age of Empire and Halo in his spare time during medical school, said time spent in front of a screen helped his surgery skills.

 Saied Froghi  Saied Froghi, right, with his brother Farid Froghi, a surgery research fellow, who joked ""all those years of gaming paid off""

""If you take the example of keyhole surgery, your eyes focus on a screen and your hands move synchronously with what you are doing,"" he said.

""That's a similar scenario to when you are playing football with a games console. Your hands know where the buttons are and how to rotate the instrument.""

Another former video games player - Rajin Chowdhury, a registrar in anaesthetic and intensive care at Sheffield Teaching Hospital - said he was ""more dextrous"" because of his hobby.

Video games, he said, improved hand-eye coordination because they trained the surgeon to perform the surgery remotely from a screen.

""For example in an appendicectomy, because of the way the camera is inserted in the abdomen, when you move it down [in the body] you move it up on the image. When I want to move right you have to move it left.

""It's not intuitive.""

 Rajin Chowdhury says games which require decent hand-eye co-ordination can help with some procedures

One consultant surgeon in Leeds tweeted a story he was told of how a junior doctor got the job done during an operation, citing his Nintendo skills as a help.

Skip Twitter post by @CowlingSurgeon One of my previous bosses told a great story of a senior Reg struggling to retrieve a loose body arthroscopically, only for the house officer, 1st time in theatre, plucking it out with ease, citing his Nintendo skills as the cause of his dexterity. â Paul Cowling (@CowlingSurgeon) October 30, 2018 Report

'Skills can be taught'

Meanwhile Susan Hill, vice president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""I have not noticed any great difference in the dexterity of the medical students or junior doctors I come into contact with, when compared to other generations.

""In fact, I can recall finding some surgical techniques extremely difficult to master myself even though I trained well before the IT revolution,"" she said.

""Although it may be useful for a surgeon to be naturally dexterous, the skills required to operate can be taught.

""Much of surgical training is about practising skills such as cutting and sewing over and over until they are perfected.""

Professor Steve Wigmore, a professor of surgery from the University of Edinburgh. said research is showing that playing computer games ""is a good warm up"" to performing keyhole, or laparoscopic surgery.

""I think the quality of the trainees is down to the quality of the training,"" he said.

NHS surgeon and surgery professor Peter Brennan is the chairman of the MRCS exam for the UK and Ireland - the exam which junior doctors need to pass to become surgeons.

He said: ""We are not going to let people pass that exam if we don't think they have the skills"".

And he added medical students who want to become surgeons often may choose that career path because they are ""good with their hands"".

Many surgeons said practice is one of the top ways to improve their stitching and suturing skills - a rule which applies for both the current medical students - and older generations.

"'I never knew men could get breast cancer'","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6B61/production/_103898472_musongapic.jpg"," Moses Musonga says the treatment can be extremely painful

Moses Musonga never thought men could get breast cancer until he was diagnosed with the disease.

The 67-year-old Kenyan told the BBC that he was in profound shock when doctors told him in 2013 that he had stage-three breast cancer, turning his life upside down.

""I was in denial and wondered why such a disease, which is not male-oriented, had singled me out of millions of men in the world,"" Mr Musonga said.

It all started with a painless lump in his right nipple that grew larger as time went by. Then came the nipple discharge and occasional chest pains.

Doctors kept on giving Mr Musonga, a father of five, painkillers to treat something they were unsure about.

And despite the fact that his breasts were unusually bigger than those of most men, Mr Musonga never thought it was anything to worry about.

He sought medical help when the skin on his right breast began to ulcerate.

  'I was in denial about male breast cancer'

Tests on a tissue sample confirmed that Mr Musonga had breast cancer.

""I hadn't known that breast cancer affects men and therefore didn't notice that what was affecting me was breast cancer,"" he said.

Dr Sitna Mwanzi, a consultant medical oncologist at the Aga Khan University Hospital in the capital, Nairobi, said male breast cancer is not very common.

Her experience showed that for every 100 breast cancer patients, one will be male.

Why do men get breast cancer?

 

Exact cause is unknown but risk of getting it increases because of:

Genes and family history, including inheriting faulty versions of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes

Conditions that can increase the level of oestrogen in the body, including obesity, Klinefelter syndrome and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)

Previous radiotherapy to the chest area

It is not certain if you can do anything to reduce your risk, but it may help if you:

Eat a balanced diet

Lose weight if you are overweight

Avoid drinking too much alcohol

Source: UK's National Health Service

About 6,000 cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in Kenya this year - making up 12.5% of all cancers in the country, according to Globocan 2008, which is part of the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.

Across the whole of Africa, they expect about 170,000 cases.

Dr Mwanzi said women are more at risk for various reasons, including the fact that they have more oestrogen naturally than men.

""When you have an excess of oestrogen, it stimulates a formation of more breast tissue and with that some of the cells can become abnormal and lead to breast cancer,"" she said.

 Dr Mwanzi says the chances of men getting breast cancer are extremely rare

Dr Mwanzi added that both men and women should keep an eye out for symptoms, especially a lump on the breast.

Other symptoms include changes in the skin on the breast and the nipple, bloodstained discharge from the nipple, and a change in the shape or size of one or both breasts.

Cancer also brings about weight loss, she added.

Dr Mwanzi said the main treatments for breast cancer were radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone therapy.

""Men should examine their breasts for lumps on a regular basis. They should be checking themselves very often,"" she added.

Mr Musonga said breast cancer treatment, especially if the disease is at an advanced stage, is extremely painful.

""The hair on my head was not shaved but was removed by chemicals.

""I cannot walk for long and struggle with fatigue, nausea and vomiting on a daily basis,"" he said.

'No discrimination'

The 67-year-old had to quit lecturing at a college after starting chemotherapy sessions that caused loss of breath.

   Both women and men are urged to learn about breast cancer

As breast cancer is linked to women, Mr Musonga had feared that he would face some discrimination when he told people about the diagnosis.

""Instead of being shocked and judgemental, most people are curious and want to know more about breast cancer in men because it's believed to be a woman's disease,"" he said.

He advised men to take the disease seriously, and to seek treatment early on.

""They should accept it. They can be treated and go back to their normal lives,"" he added.","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:15:11 GMT"

"Doctors gave me a new penis - I want to find love","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/97CE/production/_104026883_anick_a_pdc0259_976650.jpg","Earlier this year, 23-year-old Anick - who was born intersex - was getting ready for the last in a series of operations that would give him a fully-functioning penis. The BBC followed his progress.

""I've lost count of how many doctors and nurses have seen me naked over the years,"" says Anick. ""In the past few years alone it's been more than 100.""

Anick was born with genitals that didn't resemble either a boy's or a girl's.

""The doctors said to my parents: 'This child is mostly like a boy, but we're not sure yet,'"" he says.

He did have testicles but they were in the wrong place, so his first operation - to move them - came at the age of four months.

Throughout his childhood, people would tell Anick that he wasn't really like other boys.

""I knew there was something different about me, but I didn't understand what,"" he says.

""I knew that my parents loved me, but at the same time they were taking me to the hospital every six months, where the doctors would use words like 'abnormal' and 'atypical' when they were talking about me.""

He found it hard to make friends at school, and remembers holding his breath as a young child, in an attempt to suffocate himself, and wrestling with the childproof safety caps on bottles of bleach.

After a more serious suicide attempt at the age of 14 he was given counselling, but couldn't bring himself to reveal the source of his troubles to the counsellor.

""I didn't want anyone else to know who didn't need to know,"" he says. ""It was very, very isolating.""

 Anick as a teenager

""I thought no-one knew what was different about me, that I was the only one in the world, just some random miracle case,"" he says.

It was only five years ago, at the age of 18, that he learned there was a name for this - and the reason for all his operations and hormone treatments: he was ""intersex"".

This discovery, and the realisation that there are other people out there like him, made a huge difference, he says: ""Suddenly I realised that I don't have to be ashamed of who I am and how I was born.""

Doctors had also told Anick that he could begin reconstructive surgery to create a new penis when he turned 18 and could give his own consent. They told him not to rush to any decision and to go ahead only when he felt comfortable.

Three years later, in 2016, Anick decided that he was ready.

""That's when I had an epiphany,"" he says. ""I needed to start telling people. I needed to tell the truth. I was going to be going through a lot of major surgeries, and how many times can you have your appendix out? I'd lost count of the number of times I'd used that excuse.""

He began by telling his cousins, uncles and aunts and was surprised when they didn't react with disgust.

""I didn't know people could be so accepting of something I had been hiding for so long,"" he says.

The final operation was scheduled for June 2018, giving Anick hope that before long he would at last feel confident enough to embark on his first ever romantic relationship.

It's February 2018 and Anick is on his way to the Organisation Intersex International (OII) conference in Copenhagen. He's excited but also really nervous.

""It's quite surreal,"" he says. ""For the first time in my life I won't be the odd one out. I'm finding out about my people - that sounds weird, but that's what it feels like.""

Delegates like Anick are arriving from all over the world to discuss issues that concern all of them, and to share their experiences.

""As weird as this may sound, within a few hours of meeting we were all talking about our genitals,"" Anick says.

Intersex

An umbrella term used to describe people who are born with biological variations in their sex characteristics that don't fit typical male or female categories

There are many possible variations, involving genitalia, ovaries and testicles, chromosome patterns and hormones

According to the UN, about 1.7% of people are intersex

He enjoys the feeling of being around people to whom he doesn't need to explain himself. He wonders if this is how it feels to be ""normal"".

But he's also surprised to find himself feeling slightly isolated too, because so many people have experiences that are different from his. It's unsettling.

""I'm with people who might understand how I'm feeling, but at the same time they haven't been through the same thing,"" he says.

Overall, it's a bittersweet experience that leaves Anick with mixed feelings.

""It's the story of my life,"" he says. ""I don't fit in as a male, I don't fit in as an intersex person. So what am I? Who am I? It sucks.""

Later Anick Skypes an intersex activist from Chicago, Pidgeon Pagonis. Like Anick, Pidgeon was born without a fully-formed penis or vagina - but in Pidgeon's case surgeons decided to create a vagina, rather than a penis.

Pidgeon was raised a girl, but now uses the pronoun ""they"" rather than ""she"". Only when they were at university did they learn the truth about the procedures they underwent as a child, and learn that they were intersex.

Pidgeon now regards these operations as unnecessary cosmetic procedures, and argues that using surgery to alter an otherwise healthy intersex child's body is a violation of human rights.

""I would say, 'Please let your child grow up as the intersex person that they are and let them one day have autonomy over their own bodies,"" Pidgeon says.

""We should be pressuring doctors to stop perfecting surgeries for infants and start perfecting surgeries for intersex adults, who may want them.""

That's an idea that chimes with Anick, who says that when he was growing up his family weren't even made aware that waiting for surgery was an option.

""If a doctor tells you your child needs surgery - you just go along with that,"" he says.

After attending the OII conference and talking to Pidgeon, Anick also thinks that many of the operations he had as a child were ""purely cosmetic"".

He has been thinking hard about whether he definitely wants the operation he is scheduled to undergo, or whether it's just something people have made him feel he needs in order to have a happier life.

But he decides to go ahead.

It's now June 2018 and Anick is about to go into hospital.

A year ago doctors took skin from Anick's left arm to create a phallus. It's taken a year for him to be able to use it to go to urinate properly.

""You've heard of the phrase, 'I wear my heart on my sleeve,' well, I kind of wear my penis on mine,"" he jokes, as he shows the large scar left behind on his forearm from where the skin was removed.

He goofs around as he gets changed into the surgical stockings, underwear and gown, a routine that's all too familiar now.

Today a prosthetic device is going to be fitted into Anick's penis that he will need to pump up if he wants to have penetrative sex.

""I kind of feel like a cyborg,"" he says. ""But at least I won't have performance or anxiety issues.""

Part of him thinks it's really cool that he is going to have this device implanted into his penis, but he does wonder how he's going to explain it to someone when he's in a relationship. He's never had a relationship, though he's hopeful that after this operation he will.

""Everything in my life is going to be different,"" Anick says. ""I'm finally going to have the closest thing to what other guys have, and maybe I'll be able to experience what other people do when they're my age. I've always avoided relationships out of disgust towards my own body and self- hatred, but I've really been working on getting over that.""

The operation goes well. Anick says that things down there look pretty different now. He's not sure how long it will take him to get used to it.

As the painkillers wear off he gets ready to go home, where his parents are going to be looking after him. It's awkward because his new penis has to stay in a specific position for the next week and it looks like he has a permanent erection.

""Whenever people come to visit me I just look really happy to see them, even when I'm not,"" he says.

A month has passed. Since coming out of hospital Anick has been in a lot of pain. He's never felt pain like this before, despite his long history of operations. There have been some complications and for the past month he's had to make repeated trips back to A&E.

But Anick is trying to put all of that to the back of his mind.

""Today is a historic day,"" he says. ""It's the first time that intersex people are going to be marching at Pride in London.""

Not all intersex people are lesbian, gay or bi, but some feel that Pride is a good place to let people know about the intersex community.

It's a baking hot summer's day and Anick together with about 30 other intersex people - most of them straight - join in the joyous, colourful celebrations taking over the streets of central London

""This time last year I had never met another intersex person,"" Anick says. ""I went to Pride on my own and was basically looking for my intersex family but couldn't find anyone. Now this year I'm going with a whole group of intersex people.""

He can't stop smiling.

""I can't get my head around how much my life has changed in the past year,"" he says.

""It's just unbelievable that this has happened. There are so many of us here today. We're all different ages, from different backgrounds, and different countries. Could you ask for a more inclusive day?""

It's now August 2018. In the month since Pride, Anick has had to have another operation to fix things that had gone wrong. The prosthetic device implanted in his penis had become wrapped around one of his testicles causing him excruciating pain.

He's still in pain now and has to be vigilant about infections, but he's hopeful that he won't need to have any more surgery for between five and seven years, when his prosthetic pump will need to be serviced or perhaps replaced if a newer model is available.

""I grew up feeling like they didn't do enough and they didn't know what was going on,"" he says. ""But I didn't realise how in the dark and overwhelmed they were. My parents weren't supported enough and they only ever did what they thought was right.""

Overall, he says, having the operation has made him much happier. He's even signed up to a dating app and has already been on a few dates.

""I'm just seeing what's out there,"" he says. ""One of the first dates wasn't that positive - I went out with a girl who told me I wasn't really a guy. And then I went out with a guy but just didn't feel anything, so I'm having the normal problems that people do with dating and relationships - that's a nice feeling.""

And he hopes that talking about what used to be the biggest secret of his life might help other people in similar situations.

""I am normal, I'm just not common,"" he says. ""There is no one intersex story, but I hope that mine inspires other people to come forward with theirs.""

"Sexually transmitted infections: What to do if you get one","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12C5A/production/_100009867_condomsmaingetty.jpg"," 

Sexually transmitted infections are rife among young adults in England.

There were 144,000 cases of chlamydia or gonorrhoea diagnosed among people aged 15 to 24 last year, according to Public Health England.

That's the equivalent of almost 400 per day, or one every four minutes.

Noah, 19, told the BBC he was in ""disbelief"" when he was diagnosed with an STI, adding he thought it was something that happened to other people.

""I'd never experienced something like that before,"" he said. ""I wasn't exactly sure what it was. I didn't want to believe it.""

So, what should you do if you have an STI?

Dr Peter Greenhouse - a sexual health consultant - says that anyone who notices anything wrong should ""get a check-up as soon as possible"" at their local sexual health clinic.

To find your nearest clinic, you can use websites such as sxt or Bashh.

If people are unsure whether or not they have an STI, they can also order a free home test online.

For those who test positive using a home kit, the next step is an appointment at the clinic.

If there are no sexual health clinics nearby, book an appointment with your local GP.

  'I've never used protection': What are these people's attitudes to safe sex?

Should you be nervous about speaking to a doctor?

It's understandable for people to feel embarrassed to speak about sexual health - but there is no reason to be nervous.

""All the people who work in sexual health clinics have been self-selected for being sympathetic about sexâ¦ for being sex positive,"" Dr Greenhouse explains.

""Most of us have been there, and even if we haven't, we're sympathetic and non-judgemental.""

If you go to a sexual health clinic, the last thing you need is someone telling you off - and that's not what you'll get.

What are the next steps to take?

The next step, Dr Greenhouse says, is get in contact with your partner - or former partners - to alert them about your situation.

It may be embarrassing, but warning former partners that they might have an infection means they can get treated quickly and it could stop them from passing it on to someone else.

   You'll need to warn your former partners

Most STIs can be cured with a simple course of antibiotic pills or cream - it's essential you do not engage in sexual activity until you have completed your course of antibiotics.

For longer-lasting infections, consult your doctor about the best way to manage future sexual activity.

What's the best way to alert former sexual partners?

First of all, don't panic.

Remember, however overwhelmed you may feel, your doctor is there to help you.

You can tell previous partners yourself, with some people preferring to do it face to face, and the doctor can give you advice on the best way to do it.

But if that is something you don't feel up to, some clinicians will offer to make the calls for you.

Other clinics even have an anonymous texting service they use, telling the person a former partner has been diagnosed with an STI and how to get tested.

There are also a number of online tools that offer a similar experience.

The important thing is to let them know so they can get treated, as well as to stopping the infection from spreading further.

 

Fact or fiction?

There are plenty of myths about STIs - and information online is not always accurate.

Here are a few myths that need busting:

Can you catch chlamydia from a toilet seat? No, chlamydia is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through unprotected sex or contact with sexual fluids.

Can you catch STIs from sharing a towel? The only STI that has a chance of being spread in this way is pubic lice. They are parasitic insects that live in pubic hair, armpit hair or even in your eyebrows.

Will the contraceptive pill stop me from getting an STI? No. The pill is used for birth control, or sometimes to regulate periods. To be protected from STIs you need to use a condom as well.

Read more on sexual health myths here.

How can you prevent it happening again?

Dr Greenhouse's main advice is to always use condoms when you start a new sexual relationship.

Once both partners have been tested and given the all-clear, then you can consider replacing condoms with another form of contraception, should you so wish.","Thu, 25 Oct 2018 14:14:33 GMT"

"'The food supplement that ruined my liver'","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/305E/production/_104028321_17bd01f8-3094-4a71-8e8a-4f2b0238d967.jpg"," Jim McCants

Jim McCants took green tea capsules in a drive to get healthy in middle age. His doctors now say they left him needing an urgent liver transplant, writes the BBC's Tristan Quinn.

It should have been one of the happiest days of his life. But Jim McCants looks back on his youngest son's high school graduation with mixed emotions. As he sat down next to his wife Cathleen in the university auditorium, just outside Dallas, Texas, she turned to look at him.

""She said 'Do you feel OK?'"" Jim recalls. ""I said, 'Yeah I feel fine, why?' 'Your face is yellow, your eyes are yellow, you look terrible.' When I looked in the mirror it was shocking.""

It was shocking partly because Jim, then 50, had been working on improving his lifestyle and losing weight, focusing on eating more healthily and taking regular exercise.

""My dad had a heart attack at aged 59 and he did not make it,"" says Jim. ""There's a lot that he missed out on with us and I was determined to do what I can to take care of myself as best I can, so that I don't miss out.""

But soon after his son's graduation, Jim was admitted to hospital with a suspected liver injury.

Trying to identify the cause of Jim's liver injury, those treating him ruled out alcohol.

""For the last 30 years I drank maybe a six-pack of beer a year, no wine. So alcohol was not a big part of my life,"" Jim says.

They also ruled out prescription drugs - he wasn't taking any at the time - and smoking, something he had never done.

""Then my hepatologist drilled in to, 'What about any over-the-counter supplements?'"" says Jim.

As part of his mid-life health kick, Jim had started taking a green tea supplement because he had heard it might have cardiac benefits. These supplements have grown in popularity in recent years, often breathlessly promoted online for their antioxidant benefits, and their supposed ability to aid weight loss and prevent cancer.

If you are drinking modest amounts of green tea you're very safe Prof Herbert Bonkovsky, Wake Forest University School of Medicine

""I felt fine then,"" remembers Jim, who lives in Prosper, north of Dallas. ""I was walking or running 30-to-60 minutes, five or six days a week."" He was working as a finance manager but hoped to retrain as a physician assistant. ""I was taking two or three classes at a time at nights and at weekends,"" he recalls.

He had been taking the green tea supplement for two to three months when he became ill. According to Jim's medical record this is the presumed cause of his liver injury. ""It was shocking because I'd only heard about the benefits,"" remembers Jim. ""I'd not heard about any problems.""

After his admission to hospital, Jim went into a ""holding pattern"", waiting for the results of a series of blood tests to establish the seriousness of his liver injury. Then, about three weeks after his wife had first noticed he looked ill, one of his liver doctors delivered the news he had been fearing: ""She said you need a liver transplant. This has to happen fast. You have days - you don't have a week.""

Jim was stunned.

""I was thinking this looks very bleak for me. It really crystallises what's important in life. I wasn't there thinking about projects at work. I was thinking of different people that were important to me for different reasons.""

 

What is it about green tea supplements that might cause harm at certain doses to some people? Scientists do not know for certain. Because green tea has been drunk for thousands of years, supplements consisting of its concentrated form are regulated in the US and Europe as foods, not medicines. That means that specific safety testing has not been required, so the scientific picture of how green tea supplements might affect our health is incomplete.

""If you are drinking modest amounts of green tea you're very safe,"" says Prof Herbert Bonkovsky, director of liver services at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina, who has been tracking injuries linked to green tea supplements for nearly 20 years. ""The greater risk comes in people who are taking these more concentrated extracts.""

Concern has focused on a potentially toxic ingredient called Epigallocatechin-3-gallate or EGCG, the most abundant of the naturally occurring compounds with antioxidant properties in green tea, called catechins. There are likely to be a number of factors that might make an individual susceptible to harm from EGCG including genetics, and the way supplements are used.

""Usually people are taking these green tea extracts trying to lose weight, so they're often not eating,"" Dr Bonkovsky explains. ""We know from animal studies that fasted animals absorb a much higher percentage of the catechins than do fat animals. There may well be other factors of other drugs, other chemicals, use of alcohol that are also important as modifying factors.""

Antioxidants

Antioxidants are a group of vitamins and other compounds that for many have taken on miraculous properties, helping to drive the global market for supplements of all kinds, now worth more than Â£100bn per year.

Antioxidants ward off ""free radicals"", molecules produced in our cells as they turn oxygen and food into energy. Just as oxygen and water corrode iron, too many free radicals can damage our cells.

In the 1950s, Prof Denham Harman theorised that free radicals drove the process by which the body ages and could lead to disease.

But some scientists now believe that free radicals at certain levels may be beneficial for human health, and argue that the orthodox view of the last half century that antioxidants are an unalloyed good is outdated.

While millions of people take green tea supplements safely, at least 80 cases of liver injury linked to green tea supplements have been reported around the world, ranging from lassitude and jaundice to cases requiring liver transplants. Those harmed after taking green tea pills have included teenagers, like 17-year-old Madeline Papineau from Ontario, Canada who developed liver and kidney injury, and an 81-year-old woman diagnosed with toxic acute hepatitis.

A recent investigation by the European Food Safety Authority into the safety of green tea concluded that catechins from green tea drinks are ""generally safe"", but when taken as supplements catechin doses at or above 800mg per day ""may pose health concerns"". The EFSA could not identify a safe dose on the basis of available data and called for more research to be carried out.

The day after Jim was told he needed a liver transplant, amazingly he was told a suitable liver had been found. ""I was elated. The phone call that there was a match gave me hope that there would be something positive on the other side of this for me,"" he says.

The liver transplant saved Jim's life. But four years later he still has serious health problems including kidney disease that may require dialysis and a transplant in the future. He sees his liver and kidney doctors twice a year, and lives with chronic abdominal pain.

""My life before was pretty active. And now it's much more sedentary and I struggle with fatigue,"" he says.

I didn't expect harm - I expected that I might waste my money

It's a ""tremendous blessing"", as he puts it, that his managers allow him to work from home. ""I may need a lie down for 20 or 30 minutes during the day. I'm able to just let my manager know I'm going offline, I'll be back.""

Jim is pursuing a lawsuit against the American firm Vitacost, which sold the green tea supplement he took. ""I'm hoping that they make the decision to put a very strong warning label on the product, on the website, let people know before they buy it,"" he says.

Vitacost did not want to comment on the legal case, but said: ""We take the safety of our Vitacost brand supplements very seriously and stand behind the quality of our products.""

Four years on, Jim reflects on how his life and that of his family changed after he took a green tea supplement.

""I didn't expect harm. I expected that I might waste my money, I may take these and they don't do a bit of good. I can accept that risk,"" he says. ""But the risk that it could cause my liver to fail, that's a risk that's too high for somebody to take.""

"The places where too many are fat and too many are thin","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14758/production/_104000838_obesity11.jpg"," 

Obesity is often portrayed as a Western problem, with under-nutrition found in poorer countries.

But the truth is more complex. Nine out of 10 countries are in the grip of a health epidemic known as the ""double burden"" - where overweight and undernourished people live side-by-side.

A worldwide explosion in the availability of unhealthy foods, a shift towards office jobs and the growth of transport and television are among the many causes.

Often, this double burden occurs not only within a community, but also within the same family.

It can even happen within the same person, who is overweight but lacking in vital nutrients. Alternatively, they can be part of a phenomenon known as ""thin-fat"", where people appear to be a healthy weight, but carry large amounts of hidden fat.

Obese children

Every country in the world is struggling with a nutrition problem of some kind.

The number of people suffering from chronic food deprivation reached an estimated 815m in 2016 - a 5% increase in two years. Much of the increase was in Africa, where 20% of people were malnourished.

Meanwhile, obesity rates have tripled over the last 40 years. Globally, more than 600m adults are obese, while 1.9bn are overweight.

The number of obese people in developing countries is catching up with the developed world.

The highest rates of childhood obesity can be found in Micronesia, the Middle East and the Caribbean. And since 2000 the number of obese children in Africa has doubled.

In many places it is common to find children whose diet does not meet their needs.

In South Africa, almost one in three boys are overweight or obese, while a further third are underweight.

In Brazil, 36% of girls are overweight or obese, while 16% are classed as underweight.

Money to spend

Lifestyle changes are partly to blame for the double burden of obesity and under-nourishment.

Many low and middle-income countries, such as India and Brazil, have a new middle class with disposable income, rather than just the money to spend on essentials.

Often, this has meant a move away from traditional foods towards more Western diets high in sugars, fats and meat, and low in unrefined grains and beans.

In some countries this has also happened as people move from the countryside to the city, where there is much more choice of food.

For example, a study of young children in China suggested that in the countryside, obesity rates were 10%, while the malnutrition rate was 21%. In cities, 17% of children were obese while 14% were malnourished.

   Obese students at a weight loss summer camp in Zhengzhou, China

Although many people's diets may be higher in calories, they can still offer too few vitamins and minerals.

Professor Ranjan Yajnik, a diabetes specialist in Pune, India, is seeing first-hand one impact this change of diets is having.

""Diabetes was considered a disease of the older and more obese,"" he says. ""But in India we're seeing it in younger people and with a lower BMI.""

Indians are eating fewer nutrient-rich foods and getting more calories from junk food, he says, resulting in the problem of thin-fat - ""people who are thin by most criteria are actually carrying large amounts of hidden fat"".

Hidden, or visceral fat, accumulates around internal organs, including the liver. High levels of visceral fat may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, even if the carrier doesn't look overweight.

Tackling hunger

Children are particularly vulnerable to unhealthy diets, as they need vitamins and minerals in order to grow and develop normally.

Some households contain children who are undernourished, even as they eat the same diet as their obese parents, because they are deficient in vitamins.

Research also suggests stunted or malnourished children are more likely to become overweight later in life, as their metabolism slows and their body hangs on to fat reserves.

 

This means countries need to be careful that policies aimed at tackling hunger do not accidentally add to the problem of over-nutrition.

In Chile during the 1920s, a national programme was introduced to provide rations to pregnant women and the under-sixes.

This reduced hunger but in the long-term is thought to have contributed to Chile's rapidly rising rates of childhood obesity.

The West

While the double burden may be particularly prevalent in developing countries, the problem is also found in richer nations.

In the UK, for example, more than a quarter of adults are obese, costing the NHS an estimated Â£5.1bn each year.

At the same time, 3.7m children live in households which cannot afford to follow healthy dietary guidelines, with one in 10 living with severe food insecurity.

In the European Union, 14% of 15-19 year-olds are underweight, and a similar proportion are overweight or obese. However, more than half of over-18s are overweight or obese, while just 2% are underweight.

Choices

The causes of this double burden are complicated.

It is not only a question of having access to healthy foods, and no two people or cultures view nutrition in the same way.

Our food choices are influenced by many things, some of which we may not be aware of.

They include cost, local availability, time pressures, healthily eating knowledge and the diets of people around us.

And every person's nutritional needs are different. This partly depends upon their metabolism and how good their health was to start off with.

 

The cost to the individual and society of over and under-nutrition are numerous.

Children who grow up undernourished often do worse in school and earn less throughout their life.

Childhood obesity is likely to lead to poorer health in adulthood, and increases the risk of diseases like cancer later on.

Malnutrition is a particular risk for older people - making them twice as likely to visit their doctor and at risk of longer hospital stays.

Making progress

In developing countries, problems like diabetes and heart disease are likely to soar in tandem with obesity rates.

For health systems which have traditionally focused on infectious diseases such as malaria and have small budgets, this will be a huge challenge.

What can be done? South America - where many countries suffer from the double burden - is leading the way.

 

Brazil was the first country to sign up to the UN's Decade of Action on Nutrition, making many commitments. These include halting the growth in obesity, cutting consumption of sugary drinks by 30% and increasing fruit and vegetable intake by 18%. It aims to achieve these with policies such as microloans to farmers, reducing tax on certain fresh foods and educating children on nutrition.

Mexico was the first country to implement a 'sugar tax', imposing a 10% levy on artificially sweetened drinks in 2014.

This tax is predicted to reduce obesity rates by 12.5% in 12 years, and other countries such as the UK are now adopting similar measures.

But much more is needed in order to halt this global nutrition crisis.

"'One stroke took my speech away - I think another brought it back'","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D714/production/_103606055_stutterillustration5.jpg","Peter lost his ability to speak after a stroke four years ago, at the age of 73. But earlier this year he woke up one morning and suddenly he could speak again. Soon afterwards he discovered he'd had another stroke. Could the second stroke have returned his speech?

The day that Peter regained his speech, he was on holiday in Devon with his family.

""I woke up as usual. Carol was on the other side of the bed. I stood up and spoke to her, but it didn't feel weird. It felt like I was talking to my wife - like the most natural thing to do.

""I kept talking to her, and her mouth just dropped open. She said, 'Pete, you're speaking!'""

""I was going: 'Come on! Don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop because it might go away again. Keep going, keep going!'"" remembers Carol.

Their son, Jonathan, who was in the next room, heard two people having a conversation and came rushing in. ""What's going on, Mum?"" he said. ""I thought your voice had dropped! Who is that deep voice?""

""I said, 'It's your father speaking!'"" says Carol. ""We all started crying and laughing at the same time. It was very emotional because it had been so long.""

It was such a shock, nobody can remember what Peter's first words in four years were.

""Carol wasn't interested in what I said, she was more interested in the fact that I was talking,"" says Peter.

Peter and Carol spoke to Dr Mark Porter on Inside Health on BBC Radio 4

Listen to their interview here

They all went out to celebrate, but Carol soon noticed that the left-hand side of Peter's mouth was drooping. Later in the day he complained of weakness in his legs - he had difficulty walking, and his son Jonathan had to hold him up.

They took a taxi to the nearest hospital where a scan suggested he'd had another stroke. Fortunately, however, the negative effects were only temporary. Peter's mouth stopped drooping and his legs returned to normal. And months later, he's still talking.

The couple are convinced that this second stroke somehow ""dislodged"" something in Peter's brain - something that had stopped him talking after the first stroke.

However, Alex Leff, a professor of cognitive neurology and an expert in the recovery of language after stroke and brain injury, offers little support for this theory. He says you can think of the brain as a network, and of a stroke as an event that ""takes out"" some of the language nodes. In many cases, patients ""reroute some of the language functions using what is remaining in the brain"", he says - but when they have had severe language problems, like Peter, this tends to be a slow process, not a sudden one.

The case is ""certainly very unusual"", he says.

Aphasia

Aphasia is the technical term for the difficulties with language or speech that a person may experience after a stroke, or other brain injury

There are several different types

With Broca's aphasia (or non-fluent aphasia) speech is limited mainly to utterances of less than four words, which take a lot of effort to produce - the person may understand speech well, and be able to read, but is usually limited in writing

(or non-fluent aphasia) speech is limited mainly to utterances of less than four words, which take a lot of effort to produce - the person may understand speech well, and be able to read, but is usually limited in writing People who have anomic aphasia experience a persistent inability to find the words for the things they want to talk or write about, particularly the significant nouns and verbs - they understand speech well and usually read adequately

Carol was with Peter when he had his first stroke. They had been out, but Peter hadn't been feeling well, so Carol was driving them back to their Gloucestershire home.

""I asked him for the time and he didn't answer me,"" says Carol. ""I asked him again. I just sensed that something was wrong. When you live with somebody and have been married 52 years you know everything, don't you?""

Afterwards, over a period of weeks, Peter gradually felt his ability to speak fade away.

""I found it more and more difficult to have a proper conversation,"" he says. ""Words were difficult to find, I couldn't get any flow to sentences. The words were coming out staccato-like.

""In the end it felt almost impossible to speak. I could only say 'Yes' and 'No' and occasionally a very short phrase. That was the best I could do.""

I always knew exactly what was going on - being unable to converse with people is the worst

Carol found it heartbreaking to see her husband, a retired engineer who she describes as a ""clever and eloquent man"", unable to speak. The whole family shared her distress.

Their daughter, Jane, admitted to her mother, ""I really miss Dad.""

Carol told her, ""Well, he's not dead, he's not gone away. It's awful for us, but it's dreadful for him - and that's what you've got to remember.""

Despite being unable to form words, Peter says that he was always able to understand everyone's conversation.

""I always knew exactly what was going on around me, so I was completely aware - but being unable to converse with people is the worst,"" he says.

The couple perfected a system to communicate with each other. Carol would ask yes/no questions and Peter would respond with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down gesture. He also carried round a pencil and pad, writing down what he wanted to say.

""We got by very well,"" he says.

""We made light of it,"" Carol adds. ""Well, we've got to carry on, we're getting old. You expect something to happen.""

Peter has a strong interest in photography, so if they went to a camera shop and he wanted to ask a technical question he would write it down in advance.

Sometimes Carol would explain the need for this unusual form of communication.

""I would tell them, 'My husband's had a stroke. He can't speak so he's written down a question for you.'""

During his silent years Peter would often spend the day reading or working on mathematical modelling. Carol remembers that he was always scribbling algorithms and equations in notebooks. ""It kept him quite busy actually.""

Peter says the relief of being able to speak again is overwhelming. He gets tearful about it.

""Being able to communicate with other people is almost all of being a human being,"" he says. ""When that goes, it's a big part of you gone and my family felt that I had sort of disappeared. You can't really convey emotion with 'Yes' and 'No'.""

He loves an argument, he could argue with an empty room

They tried to include him in the conversation, and make him laugh, but it wasn't the same, he says.

The most challenging part was listening to people say things that he didn't agree with.

""I found it particularly frustrating when people were arguing about something and I couldn't respond in the conversation - it was like losing every argument,"" Peter says.

""It's nice to be able to argue again and make myself a nuisance.""

His first big debate was about Brexit with friends. ""They said to me, 'Oh, I'm glad you're back!'""

Carol chips in: ""Oh he loves an argument, he could argue with an empty room.""

Peter's speech is near-perfect now, apart from some slurring when he gets tired in the evenings. But everyone has remarked on how his accent has changed.

""People say that I am speaking a bit posh now,"" he says.

""I tell them that I'd always been a bit posh really, but I'd tried to hide it from them.""

Banter and friendly bickering is clearly a big part of Peter's relationship with Carol.

She admits that she got so used to speaking for him that she's now having to adapt to him piping up again.

""It's a habit,"" she says. ""When we were at the hospital I kept talking for him. I've got to learn to shut up and button it. I have had a bit of a monopoly the past few years.""

On the day he could suddenly speak again, Peter looked pointedly at the nurse and said, ""I think Carol is going to regret this.""

""At times, I do,"" she admits. ""I told you to be quiet the other day, you've done nothing but natter.""

But both of them worry he may lose his new-found ability again.

""It's such a delicately balanced thing,"" says Peter, ever the engineer.

""It's like a watch that's been knocked with a hammer and come back, and it could have another knock and go away - like a bad contact.""

Peter asked that the BBC not use his full name.

"When women got pills for hysteria and advice to keep vaginas clean","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5D2C/production/_103925832_b27b8e3b-8dcf-4ef0-b886-37dfcc5da3f4.jpg","A new exhibition by the Royal College of Nursing showcases a series of strange, sometimes disturbing objects used in women's healthcare.

From pink pills to help women with so-called hysteria, to vaginal douches to keep them ""clean"", the historical displays show how gynaecology has often been dominated by superstition and ignorance.

Marvel Whirling Spray vaginal douche, circa 1900

In the early 19th century, vaginal douching was popular. Douching is the flushing of water, sometimes containing antiseptics, fragrances and vinegar, upwards into the vagina.

This primitive-looking object came with a booklet of advice in which the author suggests that women who are married might like to douche more often.

It states that douching is important and ignorance of its use leads to ""misery, woe and utter despair"".

Douching is now considered to be dangerous. Doctors say flushing water up into the vagina can disrupt the natural bacteria and cause irritation, infections and STIs.

Current advice is to use plain, non-perfumed soaps to wash the vagina, rather than flushing water into it.

Even so, the practice is still relatively common in the US.

Dr Tracey Loughran, of the University of Essex, who is leading a project into women's health for the Wellcome Trust said: ""Douching is presented as outdated, but it is still common and suggests an ongoing sense of shame and stigma around women's bodies.""

Dr Williams's Pink Pills, 1850-1920

These were advertised as an iron-rich tonic for the blood, and claimed to be a miracle cure for a variety of ailments, including anaemia, hysteria and ""change of life"".

Thankfully the concept of hysteria has been thoroughly debunked, but in Victorian times it was a catch-all term for what was considered an exclusively female disease caused by the womb.

Symptoms were thought to include ""women's problems"" like nervousness, hallucinations and even emotional outbursts. Women going through menopause were thought to be emotionally unstable.

Before disposable sanitary pads were invented, most women used reusable ""napkins"" or rags, hence the term rag-week. These sanitary napkins were unwieldy nappy-style items with hooks to attach to underwear and clothing. The product was deemed too embarrassing to be advertised, so coupons were made to hand to a cashier. In the exhibition, they sit alongside sleek modern tampons.

Says Dr Loughran: ""In the 1930s, there are descriptions of girls being in agony using washable rags that were very hard so would chafe against their legs.

""The situation is much better now, although the issue now is one of period poverty as many women can't afford sanitary products.""

The words of Aristotle the famous philosopher, 1855

The dust jacket of this book disguises its content of health advice for women, which covers uterine drops, labour and ""testicles"" in women.

Nowadays, there's far less stigma around women's health issues, with organisations such as Girlguiding UK encouraging girls to talk about periods and end any sense of shame.

Specula, from the 19th and 20th Century

A speculum is the tool used to hold the vaginal walls open for procedures such as cervical smears. Specula like these scary-looking implements began to emerge in the 19th Century.

Nowadays, the modern equivalent is often plastic and disposable. But according to figures for April this year, cervical screening attendance was at its lowest rate in 19 years.

Iron amulet (circa 19th Century) and eagle stone (18th Century)

Miscarriage was long misunderstood and considered to be the fault of the woman.

In the 18th Century, this eagle stone was tied to the thigh in labour to ""facilitate birth"" and tied to the arm to ""hinder miscarriage"".

Wearing an iron amulet was believed to protect a pregnant woman from complications during pregnancy and birth, including miscarriage.

Radical Nurses Group newsletter, 1988

Because nursing has been a female-dominated career throughout history, it has been the place where battles around women's health were fought.

This newsletter outlines a campaign by nurses to save the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital as a service run by women for women.

The Wondering Womb exhibition is part of a growing movement aimed at normalising women's health and reproductive experiences.

Dr Tracey Loughran said: ""Ten or 15 years ago, if you heard about the menopause, it was all about HRT health scares or women going mad, now there are efforts to reclaim it as a positive experience.""

""We've had the first sanitary advert which uses red dye instead of the common coy blue.

""And there was the three-dimensional model of the clitoris. I was very struck by that, it's amazing how many women don't have a sense of their own body.""

Debra Holloway, chairwoman of the Royal College of Nursing's Women's Health Forum, said the exhibition showcased the importance of the role nurses have had throughout history in challenging assumptions about women's health.

""Myths and misconceptions about women's bodies remain widespread and in a field previously dominated by the perspectives of male doctors and physicians, all nurses now have a responsibility to advocate for women today.""

"What is BSE (aka mad cow disease)?","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/58FD/production/_103918722_cowsgetty2.jpg"," 

The first case of BSE in Scotland in a decade has been confirmed after a cow died.

In total, there have been 16 cases in the UK in the past seven years - but that's a far cry from the thousands of cattle infected at the height of the BSE crisis back in the 1980s and 1990s.

So what is it, what happened - and what's the situation now?

What does BSE mean?

It's an acronym for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and is sometimes known as mad cow disease. That's because the symptoms usually include aggression and a lack of co-ordination.

The disease infects cows and attacks their central nervous system. It's usually fatal.

BSE has been reduced to a handful of cases in the UK, with the last recorded case before this one being in Wales in 2015.

Can it affect people too?

 

Yes, it can. The human form is known as Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (or vCJD), which is also a fatal condition. It's linked to eating contaminated meat.

It progressively attacks the brain but can remain dormant for decades.

Since 1995, when it was identified, 178 deaths have been attributed to vCJD. It's thought that one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease.

But it appears that relatively few who catch the infectious agent that causes the disease then go on to develop symptoms.

What happened during the epidemic?

There was an outbreak that started in the late 1980s in the UK.

It led to high-risk offal being banned for human consumption in 1989. Lots of people feared eating things like burgers as a result.

The following year, John Gummer - who was agriculture minister at the time - claimed beef was ""completely safe"" and appeared in front of journalists trying (unsuccessfully) to get his four-year-old daughter to eat a burger. But this was before any risk to humans was established.

The epidemic reached a peak in 1992/3 when there were 100,000 confirmed cases. In total, it's estimated 180,000 cattle were affected.

To try to stop the disease, 4.4 million cattle were slaughtered.

There had been a huge rise in cases of BSE because cattle used to be fed infected meat and bonemeal. Now, brain and spinal cord don't go back into the food chain and there's also a more rigorous monitoring process in place.

Strict controls were introduced to protect the public, after the link between BSE and vCJD was discovered.

It meant it was illegal to sell certain cuts of beef and included a ban on sales of beef-on-the-bone, introduced in 1997 and lifted two years later.

Another one of those measures was to import plasma to treat people born after 1 January 1996, in case they got exposed to the disease through blood products.

Many countries also stopped importing beef from the UK - China only ended their ban earlier this year.

So what's the situation now?

The Scottish government has imposed a movement ban on the affected farm, which hasn't been named, and they're investigating how the cow got infected.

In this case, the infected animal didn't enter the human food chain.

There's no risk to human health, Food Standards Scotland said, and it's an isolated case.

Other cattle that had been in contact with the animal will be traced, isolated and then destroyed, in line with EU requirements.","Thu, 18 Oct 2018 16:55:25 GMT"

"My cheating boyfriend gave me HIV - here's how I got justice","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/150CB/production/_103891268_vegas_new976.jpg"," Diane Reeve

Diane Reeve didn't expect to find love again after her 18-year-long marriage fell apart. But in 2002, at the age of 50, she did. It turned out, though, that her new partner, Philippe Padieu, was sleeping around - and had given her HIV.

I'd kind of given up on love, but then a couple of people convinced me I was too young to do that and said I should get back out on the market - they suggested online dating. It was pretty brutal and I was just about to give up when I got an enquiry from Philippe.

It was just a brief, ""I like your profile, would like to meet,"" but I was intrigued. He was French and very nice looking, and I thought, ""OK, one last time, and that's it.""

We met at my martial arts school - he was also a martial artist - and then we went over to a local restaurant and had drinks and appetisers and sat for an hour and talked. I was fascinated and I guess he was too.

He had cool stories and told me a lot about himself. That was kind of refreshing because usually it's the other way around, where the woman does all the talking, and I found that exhausting.

On that first date I was pretty interested in him, but I couldn't really tell if he was feeling the same thing. But then he made this one flirtatious comment and I thought, ""Oh, OK, he is interested,"" and it went from there, we started dating fairly regularly.

 Alyssa Vincent Photography  Diane and Philippe shared an interest in martial arts

Philippe was a security analyst for a large company but he was laid off a year after we started dating. While he was looking for a new job I asked him to help me out at the school.

When he was teaching for me we'd usually go out after work and then spend the night together. We had had the talk about being exclusive pretty early on in the relationship, so I was seeing him three or four times a week and the rest of the time I was busy with the school.

I was happy, he was happy, it was good, and we were together for four-and-half years.

In 2006 my daughter was getting married and we had a wonderful ceremony.

Philippe was there - he took a video of the big family occasion - and we were all going for a family dinner afterwards. But then he called me from his cellphone and said, ""I can't go, I'm not feeling well.""

 Diane Reeve

He didn't call from his home phone, which made me suspicious, and I was furious because the dinner was very important to me.

I went by myself, but on my way home I thought I'd go by Philippe's and check on this poor sick man who couldn't make it to my family dinner.

The door was locked, the house was dark, and his car wasn't there. I sat in the driveway and cried for a long time, and then I started to get angry.

Because I'd been paying for his cellphone I was able to get into his voicemail. Two different women had left him messages and it was obvious from the voicemails that these were women that he had plans with.

I waited for a good hour-and-a-half or more and then finally I saw him coming around the corner.

When he saw my car he immediately sped away - he knew that something was up - so I followed him up and down the neighbourhood streets until he finally got on the highway. He was going 90 mph and I was right behind him. I thought, ""I can chase you all night, I got a full tank of gas.""

Eventually he pulled over. I yelled and screamed and accused him of cheating. He said, ""You shouldn't have hacked into my voicemail!"" and it went back and forth. He was so angry and started beating on the car and that scared me, so I decided that was it.

We broke up on a Saturday. The following Monday I had a well-woman examination and when the results came back there were some anomalies in the cervical cells.

They said it was human papilloma virus (HPV). I'd never had that before so I knew that he had given it to me. That shocked me and made me afraid - I had to have surgery to remove the abnormal cells and I didn't know if it would progress into cancer or not.

I wondered if I should warn the other two women. I went back through the nine months' of Philippe's cellphone records that I had, trying to find them again. I would call numbers and whenever a woman answered, I would ask, ""Are you seeing Philippe Padieu?"" and if they said ""Yes,"" I would say, ""Well, I need to talk to you a little bit.""

I found nine other women who were also seeing him that way.

Some of them were angry, some of them hung up on me, some of them were very interested, and some of them were appreciative - I got all kinds of different responses.

A lady who had been seeing Philippe, who lived close to him, was so angry that she and I decided to meet with another couple of women. We had quite an interesting lunch comparing notes and we took a picture of ourselves making an obscene gesture and sent it to him.

There was another woman who I contacted later on. We met at a little jazz bar. She'd been seeing Philippe three times a week for about a-year-and-a-half.

She did not have an exclusive relationship with him, but she was waiting for that to happen, I think. I told her everything that had happened to me - how romantic things had been with us for years, how we were building a house together, how we were going to move in together but then broke up. I told her about the HPV and that I was continuing to have health problems.

She listened very intently to what I had to say.

I said, ""This is your decision and if you want to continue to see him then that's your business,"" and I thought that would be the last time we would talk.

Three months later I got a call from the health department who said that I needed to come in for testing. I panicked because I had been having a lot of health problems in addition to the abnormal cervical smear.

I had kept Philippe's phone in case somebody called and I could warn them too. I looked at it again after I was contacted by the health department and noticed that the last person to call it was the woman that I'd met at the jazz bar.

I called her and I said, ""I just got a call from the health department, what can you tell me about this?""

She said four words that I will never forget: ""We need to talk.""

  Diane Reeve describes the moment she learned that her partner had infected her with HIV

She had continued to see Philippe after we'd met but she'd then decided to break it off. She'd started to worry about sexually transmitted diseases and had gone to get tested. Her doctor had called her and told her that there was bad news, she was living with HIV.

At that point I just knew that everything that I had gone through over the last six months - the health problems, not having any energy, things that I had attributed to getting a little bit older - all these puzzle pieces fitted together and I knew what I was facing.

The next day I had an appointment with my gynaecologist and they took some blood. The following day they called me with the results.

""Diane, I'm sorry. It's positive.""

I dropped the phone and fell to my knees. I thought I was going to die.

I had not followed HIV closely - I remembered when there was no cure, and I knew that there was medicine now, but I didn't really know how effective it was. And I knew that I was really, really sick.

 Alyssa Vincent Photography  Diane Reeve today

That was January 2007.

When I went for further testing I found out that I had Aids. That means that your immune system is damaged to the point that you are very vulnerable to illness. Your body just won't fight back because the virus has damaged the cells which fight off infection.

I had health insurance because I was self-employed; I had just changed policies about two months before I got the diagnosis. There was a disclaimer at the end of the policy which said, ""Please be aware that we do not cover HIV,"" which I had signed happily, because I knew I didn't have HIV. Except two months later I found out that I did.

So I had insurance that did not pay for HIV and the medicine was about $2,000 (Â£1,500) a month and I couldn't afford it.

Almost immediately after getting the results I went to counselling. I really needed some help to process things. I was terribly depressed, I was very fearful and I was homicidally angry.

I decided to talk again to the woman I'd met at the jazz bar. We cried together, and we got angry together. When she had got her diagnosis she'd immediately called Philippe to let him know. He'd said: ""Hey, no big deal, everybody dies of something. Why don't you just go and live your life and leave me alone?""

It was a very odd reaction for someone who should have been shocked.

We suspected that Philippe had given it to both of us and we thought there had to be something that could be done about it. We did some research and within weeks of my diagnosis we decided to file a police report.

We wanted the police to stop him. We wanted them to find out if he actually did carry the virus and we wanted to find out if there was something that we could do to keep him from hurting other women.

The police were very sympathetic and understanding but said that because there were only two of us we weren't going to be able to prove it. But if four or five women came forward, they said, then they might be able to get the district attorney to take a look.

 Diane Reeve

We went back through the cellphone records. The first person I called was the woman who lived in Philippe's neighbourhood that I'd met earlier. She got tested and was also diagnosed with HIV.

She helped us by watching the house and writing down licence plate numbers of cars that were in Philippe's driveway overnight. We were kept pretty busy because he was with a different woman every night, it was incredible.

I had a friend that could run the licence tags and get a name and address, and once we had that we would go and visit them.

Altogether, we found 13 women who were diagnosed with HIV.

I was devastated that this had been going on for so long. I'd been seeing Philippe since 2002, but some of the women I talked to pre-dated me and with a different car in the driveway every night countless women had been exposed.

As the case progressed, the police department and the DA started to get involved.

To try to prove that Philippe knew that he had been diagnosed the police set up what is called a pretext phone call. I sat at the police station and called him to try to get him to admit that he knew that he was living with HIV. It didn't go very well.

He said, ""How the BLEEP did you get this number?"" and it went downhill from there.

I said, ""Hey, I heard that you weren't feeling well and I was just calling to check on you,"" and he hung up on me.

There was a lady at the health department who was helping us track down the women. I'd asked her, ""Have you ever seen this guy?"" but nothing rang a bell.

Then I remembered that Philippe sometimes used an alias, the name Phil White, and she remembered that. The timeframe that she'd seen him was around the same time that I remembered sending him to the doctor because he felt like he had kidney stones.

I thought, ""I wonder if that's when he got that diagnosis?""

It was 2005, about a year-and-a-half before we broke up. He had gone to the doctor and had some tests done.

I had paid for that medical treatment so I pulled those cheques and took them to the district attorney - that was the first time I ever saw her smile. The cheques gave her ""probable cause"" to subpoena the medical records - which she did. Without that it would have been very difficult if not impossible to obtain them, due to privacy laws - and that's how we proved that he'd been diagnosed with HIV.

Of the 13 women we found who were diagnosed with HIV only five agreed to testify in court, because of the stigma associated with the virus. We formed a support group and were able to meet at my house on a routine basis. We all got through it together.

One motive for going through with it was that the state of Texas will pay for medical care that is needed as a result of a crime, and they were prosecuting Philippe for ""assault with a deadly weapon"".

It was a long process, five to six months, of us tracking down women. Just about every day of the week we were on stake-out. It was exhausting - I still had Aids - but we were determined to stop him doing this to anybody else.

The trial finally began in 2009, three years after Philippe and I had broken up and two years after my diagnosis.

The district attorney had warned us that we would be raked over the coals, that anything that Philippe knew about us that was dirty laundry would be aired in public. Although I was prepared for it, I didn't know that it was going to be as brutal as it was - I was on the stand for about an hour, but I got through it.

After the sentencing, we gathered all of our friends and families together and we celebrated because we knew he was not going to be able to hurt anybody else again.

Philippe never took responsibility. He said that it was me that gave everybody HIV, which was obviously ludicrous - we found a woman in Michigan who he had transmitted HIV to in 1997. And we also did a DNA study that was very well controlled and scientifically proven that showed that the virus that was in each of us had a common source - and Philippe was the common source.

I suspect that he had knowingly been transmitting HIV to women for years before I met him, and that the 2005 diagnosis was not his first.

I have struggled with the forgiveness thing, but I'm at peace about it because, frankly, I took a lemon situation and made it into lemonade.

But one of the things that I resent most about what Philippe did to me and the other women is that he destroyed my ability to trust and that makes relationships really hard. I'm working my way past it, but it's been a long struggle.

I'm really lucky that I have a good relationship now with somebody who understands and loves me and accepts me. We first started seeing each other in 2008 and I disclosed to him on the second date. I started crying and he held me and said, ""It's OK, my brother died of Aids,"" and that was a very healing experience for me.

The medicine has come so far that it's one pill a day now for most people - I've been on one pill a day for a long time. I have undetectable viral load which means the virus is not detectable in my blood. It's been shown that if you are a living with HIV and you have an undetectable viral load consistently over six months there is zero transmission risk - that was a game changer for all of us.

I'm still in contact with a lot of the other women. I went to the Grand Canyon on vacation with one of them last year - the woman from the jazz bar.

If I had not met her she would have never thought to get tested and if she had not given my name to the health department I would have never gotten tested. We seriously saved each other's lives.

Growing numbers of people are also reporting they are struggling with their mental health.

If you can't see the tracker, click or tap here.

This guide is based on the latest data on performance against four NHS waiting-time measures:

A&E treatment

Cancer care

Planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements

Access to psychological treatment such as counselling

This data is currently published either monthly or quarterly depending on where you live in the UK, and there are differences between how the targets are measured in each part of the UK. See below for data sources.

The A&E target

The way the A&E target is measured is almost identical. In each case services across the UK are given four hours in which to treat and discharge or admit or transfer a patient.

They are all expected to do that in 95% of cases, although ultimately Scotland wants it services to get to 98% once 95% is achieved. There are also slight differences in the way the start time is measured.

The cancer target

There are similarities in the way cancer care is measured. Each expects patients to be treated within 62 days of an urgent referral.

In Scotland this can be following a GP or A&E referral or following a screening test.

Elsewhere it is broken down individually by referral route. So for the rest of the UK the BBC has chosen GP referral as the area to focus on as this is the most common route. Again the thresholds services are expected to achieve vary.

The planned operations and care target

The one that varies the most is for planned hospital care, which is also known as non-emergency treatment.

In England, Wales and Scotland the target measures the point at which you get a referral from your GP to the point when your treatment starts - in effect the whole patient journey.

In Scotland and England services have 18 weeks, in Wales it is 26 weeks.

Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland there are a range of targets for different parts of the patient journey. The BBC has chosen the last part, from when the decision is taken to admit the patient for treatment to when that treatment starts. It therefore does not include the tests and appointments that follow a GP referral, which can take weeks or even months. Services in Northern Ireland have 13 weeks to achieve this target.

The thresholds vary too. None is expected to achieve these goals 100% of the time. In Northern Ireland services have to achieve the target in 55% of cases, whereas in Wales it is 95%, in England 92%, and in Scotland 90%.

The mental health therapy target

There is also quite a wide variation in how access to mental health therapy is measured.

These therapies cover psychological treatments, such as counselling, for conditions such as depression, anxiety and stress.

In England and Scotland access is measured in the time it takes from getting a referral to that treatment getting under way.

Scotland publishes a combined figure for mental health for the three Islands boards - Shetland, Orkney and Western Isles - this is because the numbers being referred are relatively small.

In Wales the data only covers part of that patient journey - from when it is definitely decided treatment is needed, which is normally one-stage after a referral from a GP.

Northern Ireland does not measure access to mental health support outside of hospitals.

How local is defined

In England data is provided down to individual hospital trust level, some of these run more than one hospital. The BBC has excluded specialist trusts for cancer, children's care, women's services and orthopaedic treatment and instead focused on the 131 general hospital trusts - what most people would consider their local service.

However, mental health therapy services fall outside the control of hospitals and are organised by local NHS organisations called clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).

Elsewhere performance is broken down to health board level, known as health and care trusts in Northern Ireland. They are in charge of services for a region or large city and often run more than one hospital alongside community services.

We have chosen these boards because while some data is provided down to individual hospital level it is not done across all four targets.

How far back performance is tracked

The BBC has tracked back performance to the point at which the latest target was set or to when the records allow.

When a target has been missed for five years, we have just labelled it as that.

When targets have been hit more recently, we have provided the month they were last hit.

The targets where it has not been possible to go back five years:

in England for mental health therapy, the target of 75% was set in 2015 but only published in quarterly data from April 2016

in Scotland for A&E as the target threshold was reduced from 98% to 95% in October 2014. And for mental health the target of 90% was set in December 2014

in Northern Ireland for planned operations and care because its 13-week target threshold of 55% was set only in April 2016

in Wales the mental health target of 80% started in November 2015

The full list of dates from which the performance of local services is available are:

For England:

A&E: June 2010

Cancer: January 2009

Planned operations: April 2012

Mental health therapy: April 2016

For Scotland:

A&E: October 2014

Cancer: January 2012

Planned operations: January 2011

Mental health: December 2014

For Wales:

A&E: October 2009

Cancer: October-December 2009

Planned operations: September 2011

Mental health: November 2015

For Northern Ireland:

A&E: April 2008

Cancer: April 2009

Planned operations: April-June 2016

How the data is displayed

The bar charts displayed for each measure represent the data for each trust or board which we are tracking in each nation. As most of the data is in a fairly narrow range, we have truncated the vertical y-axis so that the detail can be seen more clearly. In the example below, the axis starts at 70%, in other charts it varies in accordance with the data.

Most blood that is donated after these events will be used -- but some may be discarded instead

 As hundreds lined up to donate blood in the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, a new study said that calls for blood donations after such mass-casualty events are not always necessary and may not be the best immediate response to such tragedies.

The study strikes a ""delicate balance"" and is not meant to dissuade people from donating blood, but it does raise critical questions about how blood donations are used after mass shootings, said Dr. James Lozada, lead author of the study, published Monday in The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery

""It's important to convey the message that blood donation is extremely important, but it's important to do it regularly throughout the year,"" said Lozada, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""The blood that is donated afterwards is very unlikely to be used for these individual tragedies.""

Most blood that is donated after these events will be used, he said, but ""some of it risks being outdated and going unused.""

""Blood is a precious commodity, and we want to use every drop of it,"" he said. ""That's why we encourage people to donate regularly rather than in the immediate aftermaths of these events.""

Krishnan Bhaskaran, lead author of the study and associate professor of statistical epidemiology, noted that his team found ""important associations"" between BMI and most causes of death.

""BMI is a key indicator of health. We know that BMI is linked to the risk of dying overall, but surprisingly little research has been conducted on the links to deaths from specific causes,"" he said.

"More than 90% of world's children breathe toxic air, affecting brain, lung and heart health","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181029114605-02-india-children-air-pollution-demonstration-file-super-tease.jpg"," Around 93% of the world's children under 15 years of age breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk, accounting for 1.8 billion children, according to a report published by the World Health Organization ahead of its first global conference on air pollution and health in Geneva.

In 2016, 600,000 children were estimated to have died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air.

Air pollution is one of the leading threats to health in children under 5, accounting for almost one in 10 deaths among this age group, the report reveals.

""This is inexcusable. Every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfil their full potential"" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement.

Air pollution also effects neurological development and cognitive ability and can trigger asthma and childhood cancer, the report says. Children exposed to excessive pollution may also be at greater risk of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease in adulthood.

""Air pollution is stunting our children's brains, affecting their health in more ways than we suspected. But there are many straightforward ways to reduce emissions of dangerous pollutants,"" said Dr. Maria Neira, director of the Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health at the WHO.

According to the WHO, children are more susceptible to pollution because they breathe more often, taking in more pollutants, and are closer to the ground, which is where some pollutants have higher concentrations.

India reaching peak season

In few places is pollution more pertinent than India's most populous city, Delhi, where residents are bracing themselves for peak crop-burning season and the annual Hindu festival of Diwali, both of which add to a thick, toxic smog cast over the city.

""Air pollution is one of the leading risk factors for the national burden of disease in India,"" the report states, adding that researchers tracked more than 1,000 women in India throughout pregnancy and found a direct correlation between increased exposure to pollution and premature, underweight babies.

Air conditions are deteriorating quickly in the country's capital; 29 monitoring stations in the city on Monday recorded ""very poor"" air quality while four stations recorded air quality as ""severe."" Delhi is now the second most polluted major city in the world, according to air quality tracker AirVisual, second only to Lahore in Pakistan.

""Weather conditions are projected to become adverse from November 1,"" warned the India Meteorological Department in a statement made last week. A task force led by the country's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has recommended a ban on all construction activities in the Delhi-NCR region for 10 days beginning November 1 to reduce dust as air quality is expected to deteriorate.

The average level of PM2.5 -- particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameterthat can dangerously clog lungs -- was 354 in the city on Monday. The WHO considers levels under 25 to be acceptable for humans to breathe regularly.

Among low- and middle-income countries, 98% of all children under 5 are exposed to PM2.5 levels above WHO air quality guidelines, the report found. In comparison, in high-income countries, 52% of children under 5 are exposed to such levels.

The most recent air pollution data from WHO released in March gave India the distinction of having the world's 10 most polluted cities.

Delhi's air is so polluted that residents could live as much as nine years longer if Delhi met WHO standards, estimated the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in a study published in 2017.

Last year, the Indian Medical Association declared a public health emergency because of alarming pollution levels and hospitals were clogged with wheezing men, women and children.

Why is it so bad in India?

As winter approaches, crop burning, firecrackers and a fall in temperatures fuel the annual deterioration in Delhi's already-poor air quality.

Every year, farmers across fertile neighboring states set fire to their fields to clear them for the next season. Known as stubble burning, the practice means millions of tons of crop residue are set alight, releasing untold amounts of particulate matter into the environment.

Stubble burning in the northern states of Punjab and Haryana contributed 32% of Delhi's overall pollution on Saturday, according to a report by the country's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

The authorities have tried to reduce crop burning by imposing fines and providing subsidies for alternative machinery, but for many farmers there is still no affordable alternative.

The city is also preparing for Diwali, the annual festival of lights, which begins this year on November 7. Residents celebrate by lighting lamps and bursting firecrackers, which have caused a sharp spike in pollution levels in previous years.

During Diwali last year, Delhi's air quality index reached 604 -- more than 24 times higher than the level the WHO deems safe.

This year, authorities hope that a Supreme Court ban on the sale of most firecrackers will help prevent a plunge in air quality, though critics are skeptical about how effective the ban will be and how it will be enforced.

What is being done about it?

In response to falling air quality in India, the country's Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) started implementation of a graded response action plan for the second year running, under which certain measures are taken as the air quality worsens.

Measures introduced so far include a periodic mechanized sweeping of roads with heavy traffic, water sprinkling on unpaved roads and an increase in parking fees of up to four times. Rules are also enforced for dust control in construction activities and only trucks registered after 2005 are permitted entry into the city.

If the situation gets bad enough, authorities will consider banning trucks and construction in the city altogether.

Government bodies have warned Delhi residents to keep windows shut, wear masks and minimize use of private vehicles to curb the effects of increasing pollution in the city. They have also advised people to avoid outdoor activities in the coming days.

What needs to be done globally

The WHO says a range of actions are needed to curb the problem and protect the health of children worldwide, including the implementation of new policies to reduce pollution levels -- such as further reducing dependence on fossil fuels and aiding the use of renewable energy, providing greater resources to heath professionals, improving waste management and locating schools and playgrounds away from busy roads and factories.

""WHO is supporting implementation of health-wise policy measures like accelerating the switch to clean cooking and heating fuels and technologies, promoting the use of cleaner transport, energy-efficient housing and urban planning,"" said the WHO's Neira.

"Check your kitchen for these recalled foods","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181026150135-01-fda-recall-1026-restricted-super-tease.jpg"," Be careful what you eat! A variety of foods, including curry powder, meats and poultry, have been recalled recently due to confirmed or possible contamination.

Curry powder may have an unwanted 'kick'

Curry powder sold under the Baraka brand and several others has been recalled.

Cases of these products were shipped to Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri and Colorado between June 15 and July 31.

Eating these lead-contaminated products may elevate blood lead levels, the FDA explained. A toxic substance, lead is present in our environment in small amounts. In general, the small exposure to lead within the U.S. population does not pose a significant public health concern, according to the FDA.

However, large amounts of ingested lead can cause poisoning with symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, weakness, behavior or mood changes, delirium, seizures and coma, the government agency noted. Children and infants are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can cause learning disabilities, developmental delays and lower IQ scores.

No safe level of lead ingestion has been identified for children, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lists 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood as the danger point for a child.

Don't be tempted to eat raw beef

A recall of raw beef products linked to a multistate outbreak of salmonella illness is ongoing.

Sixty-three additional cases of salmonella have been identified in an ongoing, multistate outbreak linked to raw beef products , the CDC reported Tuesday.

This brings the total number of people who have fallen ill to 120 in 22 states since August.

While no deaths have been reported, 33 people sickened in this outbreak have been hospitalized, according to the CDC.

The recalled products were sold nationwide under brand names Walmart, Cedar River Farms Natural Beef, Showcase, Showcase/Walmart and JBS Generic. The USDA inspection mark on the packaging of the recalled products contains the establishment number ""EST. 267.""

Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington are the latest states to report illnesses as part of this outbreak. They join Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, which all previously reported cases.

Those who are sick began experiencing symptoms between August 5 and September 28.

Symptoms of salmonella usually begin within 12 to 72 hours of consuming contaminated food. Symptoms can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever that last between four and seven days. Most people recover on their own, but those who experience persistent diarrhea may need to be hospitalized.

Chicken can cause sickness -- preparation is key

Both raw and live chickens have caused salmonella infections.

A total of 92 people in 29 states have been infected with an outbreak strain of salmonella infantis linked to chicken products , the CDC reported last week. While no deaths have occurred, 21 people have been hospitalized.

Both live chickens as well as different types of raw chicken products have been contaminated, the CDC noted. Chicken products from a variety of sources have been contaminated, the government agency said. Since a single, common supplier has not yet been identified, this might indicate widespread contamination in the chicken industry, the CDC stated.

The outbreak strain is a type of salmonella commonly found in chickens and swine, and it can cause symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. Antibiotic resistance testing on bacteria isolated from ill people shows that the outbreak strain is resistant to multiple antibiotics. This means that anyone who develops a serious salmonella infection might be more difficult to treat with standard medicines.

Because salmonella infections can spread from one person to another, the CDC recommends washing hands before and after preparing or eating food, after contact with animals, and after using the restroom or changing diapers. To kill harmful germs, raw chicken should be cooked thoroughly to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit while leftovers should be reheated toteh same temperature, according to the CDC.

Ready-to-eat meat and poultry products could lead to food poisoning

Trader Joe's is among the retailers that recalled ready-to-eat products.

Bakkavor Foods USA Inc. recalled about 795,261 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products containing an onion ingredient that may be contaminated with salmonella and listeria monocytogenes, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced Sunday.

No sickness has been reported, the USDA said.

The ready-to-eat meat and poultry items include three Harris Teeter Fresh Foods Market Deli-Bakery products: 16-ounce packages of BBQ Style Chicken Artisan Pizza; 8-ounce butcher-paper wrapped packages of Chicken Sausage, Egg White and Cheese Breakfast Burrito; and 8-oz. butcher-paper wrapped packages of Bacon, Egg and Cheese Burrito.

Another of the ready-to-eat meat and poultry items is 10-ounce butcher-paper wrapped packages of Trader Joe's Carnitas with Salsa Verde.

The products list establishment numbers ""EST. 19198,"" ""P-19198,"" ""EST. 46937"" or ""EST. 45335,"" inside the USDA mark of inspection, the government agency stated.","Sat, 27 Oct 2018 13:44:52 GMT"

"8th child dies after virus outbreak at New Jersey facility ","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181023160157-wanaque-center-exterior-super-tease.jpg"," Nine children have been reported dead at a New Jersey nursing home in the last week, at least eight from viruses that cause respiratory illness, the state health department said.

The ninth victim, described as ""medically fragile with respiratory illness"" by the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, died late Saturday night at a hospital, the state health department said in a statement. It is awaiting laboratory confirmation of adenoviruses in a child who died Friday.

The viruses are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments, and may not be eliminated by common disinfectants, but they rarely cause severe illness in healthy people. Those with weakened immune systems, though, have a higher risk for severe disease and may remain infectious long after they recover, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. They are common in places with large groups of children, such as child-care settings, schools and summer camps.

There have been 25 confirmed pediatric adenovirus cases at Wanaque, including the eight child deaths. The confirmed cases became ill between September 26 and October 22. A staff member also became ill but has recovered, the health department said.

The health department said this week the facility had been ""instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance.""

The timing of the deaths is not clear. The health department was notified of respiratory illness at the center on October 9. Wanaque sent parents of children at the facility letters about the infection on October 19, according to the health department.

On Tuesday the New Jersey Department of Health announced the death of six pediatric residents at the center and the infection of 12 additional residents. Wednesday the department announced an additional child death.

The department said it is an active outbreak investigation and lab tests could confirm additional cases.

A team at the facility on Sunday found minor hand-washing deficiencies.

""The Department continues to work very closely with the facility to ensure that all infection control measures are being followed,"" the Wanaque facility said in a statement Wednesday.

The children's ages are not being released to protect patient privacy, said Nicole Kirgan, a health department spokeswoman. They ranged in age ""from a toddler through young adults, but most are under 18.""

The outbreak, caused by adenovirus type 7, ""is affecting medically fragile children with severely compromised immune systems. The strain has been particularly associated with disease in communal living arrangements and can be more severe,"" according to the health department.

In a statement, the facility said it ""promptly notified all appropriate government agencies when the virus was initially identified.""

""The Wanaque Center continues to fully cooperate with these agencies and has sought out their medical guidance with respect to the virus,"" the facility said. ""As a result, facility staff have diligently implemented all available infection control and prevention measures in order to protect the health and safety of the Wanaque Center's residents.""

Nurses at the facility previously had reported a shortage of nursing staff and supplies, according to a statement from the union that represents the nursing staff. The Health Professionals and Allied Employees (HPAE) said the shortages may have led to ""poor infection control practices.""

The union said it represents the 70 nurses that work at Wanaque.

In a review by the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , Wanaque was awarded an above-average ranking in overall quality but was given a below-average health inspection rating. Based on an inspection conducted in August, CMS reported that ""it was determined that the facility failed to provide a clean and homelike physical environment for their residents. ""

'Environmentally hardy'

""Most of the time, adenoviruses produce influenza-like illness with cough and runny nose and feeling crummy, but you get better,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, previously told CNN. ""But they can also cause conjunctivitis and, particularly in children, diarrhea.""

In rare cases among people with weakened immune systems, the viruses may cause pneumonia or inflammation of the brain and the tissues around it. In extremely unusual cases, an adenovirus infection can result in death.

Most adenovirus infections are mild, with symptoms usually lasting about 10 days, according to the CDC. And for most patients, only home remedies and over-the-counter medicines to relieve symptoms are needed.

The viruses, unlike the flu, are not seasonal and can cause illness throughout the year. And while a vaccine exists, it's available only to military recruits.

The viruses themselves are also ""resistant to many common disinfectants and can remain infectious for long periods on environmental surfaces and medical instruments,"" the CDC says. They tend to be spread by coughing and sneezing, direct contact with an infected person, or touching objects and surfaces, such as door handles and light switches, where the viruses can live and remain infectious for days or weeks.

The viruses can ""stay stable at room temperature for weeks"" on unclean surfaces, according to Dr. Alex Valsamakis, director of Clinical Virology and Molecular Microbiology and a professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

She described this family of viruses as ""environmentally hardy.""

""Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face,"" she previously told CNN. ""That's kind of the easiest way to prevent inadvertently transporting something from your fingers into your nose or mouth.""

The infections ""usually occur sporadically -- here a case, there a case -- so outbreaks are pretty rare,"" Schaffner said.

From 2003 through 2016, the two most commonly reported adenovirus types in the US were types 2 and 3, though four additional types -- 1, 4, 7 and 14 -- also caused illness, according to a 2017 report from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease of the CDC. These six types accounted for 85.5% of 1,497 laboratory-confirmed specimens reported during the time period.

This small number of cases is believed to be an under-representation of the actual number, since most people who become sick do not go to a doctor, or their doctors do not test for this virus.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

And the viruses are still difficult to diagnose since they're not typically included in a panel of tests used to identify specific viruses, according to Schaffner. He said this is changing, and for that reason, he believes the number of cases will rise.

Still, Schaffner doesn't think people need to be worried about adenoviruses.

""They cause principally a whole bunch of minor troublesome infections spread by children, often from children to adults,"" he said. ""But they're not nearly as serious as influenza.""","Sun, 28 Oct 2018 18:17:07 GMT"

"This teen's body was 'bending by the hour.' His 18th surgery changed his life","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181022103912-sarcona-before-and-after-super-tease.jpg"," John Sarcona was at a baseball game when his mother Joanne found the bloodied T-shirts in his laundry hamper. His bedding was bloody too, and she knew something had gone terribly wrong.

""I told myself that this can't be happening,"" Joanne said. ""I'm putting two and two together, and I'm trying to get a hold of John. Nobody is answering my calls or texts, and I'm frantic, my mind is running.""

John, now 19, had been diagnosed at age 5 with what would become an extreme case of scoliosis and kyphosis. He'd already had 16 surgeries, with doctors placing metal implants along his spine to support his back as he grew.

When the 16-year-old finally came home after his mother noticed the bloody clothes, Joanne took him upstairs and calmly asked, ""John, can you take off your shirt?""

John Sarcona and his mother, Joanne, when he was 6 years old.

What she saw still haunts her: metal rods protruding from her son's back. They had broken before, requiring additional surgeries to repair, but this was different. ""They looked like cysts and tumors on John's back,"" she remembers.

Within a few weeks, John was back in the hospital for his 17th surgery to remove them once and for all, and the recovery was grueling.

""Every 15 minutes,"" Joanne said, ""the nurses would tell John to take deep breaths. But he'd say to them, 'I can't. I'm in pain. How can I keep my oxygen levels at 99% if I'm dying here?'""

""I can't do this anymore,"" John told his mom, ripping off his pulse oximeter. ""I want to go home.""

A lifetime of struggle

When he was 6 years old, John was told to wear a brace for 22 hours a day, taking it off only to shower.

John Sarcona as a young boy, before his severe scoliosis developed.

His mother decorated the brace with stickers and his classmates signed it with their names. But even in elementary school, John felt different. ""I wouldn't want to be around my friends with it on,"" he said. ""It was just so annoying.""

Scoliosis, the curving of the spine from side to side, affects about 2% to 3% percent of the population, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Kyphosis is the bending of the spine forward in the upper back -- leading to a hunchback appearance. Bracing is a common treatment for both conditions in children.

But for all its inconvenience, the brace did little to help John's worsening spine. He needed surgery, doctors said, and he soon had the operation to insert the rods into his back. Every six months, John returned to the hospital to lengthen them as he grew.

But after 17 operations, those rods were gone -- and John's condition was as bad as ever.

""It's important to understand that surgery can do a lot,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Wang, president of the North American Spine Society and co-director of the USC Spine Center. ""But surgery can't do everything. It's not always the fault of the kid or the doctor or the patient if it fails.""

John's surgeon, unable to treat him any further, recommended Dr. Lawrence Lenke, surgeon-in-chief at the Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital at NewYork-Presbyterian and a former president of the Scoliosis Research Society.

""Part of my practice is taking care of things that other people can't take care of,"" said Lenke. ""Some surgeons, at some point, are not comfortable treating these conditions.""

'How do I trust you?'

John's condition continued to worsen after he returned home from his rod removal. When the family went to NewYork-Presbyterian a month later, Lenke said that John was ""bending by the hour.""

Joanne was wary of any more procedures. Her son had been under the knife so often that doctors had trouble closing his skin after operations.

""She was a little terrified of any more surgeries,"" Lenke said, ""because none of them seemed to work. Her direct words were, 'I trusted a surgeon for so long. How do I trust you?'

Indeed, Joanne remembers, ""I didn't trust him at first. And I ask for forgiveness every day for that. But there was no other option, and the surgery had to be done.""

John's kyphosis, an outward curvature of his spine that hunched his back, was so severe that it impacted his breathing, leaving him with only 22% of his lung capacity when he arrived at NewYork-Presbyterian. ""Walking through school, even from one end to the other, I'd be out of breath,"" John remembered. ""It was definitely a struggle.""

He needed surgery, but Lenke's proposal was risky -- a slight complication and John could have been paralyzed for life.

Called a vertebral column resection, Lenke would separate John's spine into different sections, remove two vertebrae at the very center of the severe kyphosis, then straighten the spine as he brought the pieces back together.

""It does work well,"" Lenke said, ""but the issue is that we have to take the vertebra out around the spinal cord, and that's risky."" His mother was terrified, but John had few options.

""The risk of doing nothing was that her son was going to suffocate or die,"" Lenke said, ""and she could see that slowly happening.""

A moment of terror before 'a new chance at life'

The surgery was a harrowing one. For 13 hours, Lenke operated on John with a spinal fellow and a scrub nurse as other staff rotated in and out of the operating room. Not everything went according to plan.

""We test electrical activity,"" Lenke said, ""and in the middle of taking a vertebrate out, the spinal cord activity went away.""

That isn't unheard of -- Lenke said it happens in about 30% of surgeries like John's -- but ""for an hour, he was technically paralyzed.""

Lenke powered through the surgery, working quickly to remove pressure from the spinal cord, and John emerged from the operation with no complications.

""The doctors were soaking wet in their scrubs from top to bottom,"" said Joanne. ""They were completely exhausted. They never stopped working, and they saved my son's life.""

John Sarcona before his surgery, left, and after. Doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian performed a complex two-level vertebral column resection.

The top of John's spine had been bent forward over 120 degrees before his surgery, making it difficult to stand straight up and perform daily tasks like walking up stairs.

""I was collapsing on myself,"" John said. His operation was so drastic that it changed his body's center of gravity.

""Those first steps, leaning up against the bed, I felt like I was in a new body,"" John said. ""It's a pretty crazy feeling and I still remember it today. It was almost like learning how to walk again.""

It was his 18th surgery, but things felt different this time. ""This might be a chance at a new life,"" he remembers thinking. ""I could feel myself getting stronger with each step.""

From the operating room to the golf course

A year later, John graduated high school and attended his senior prom.

""I was just praying everyday for a miracle to happen, that I would be able to see my son graduate,"" said Joanne. When it finally happened earlier this year, ""it was a beautiful day,"" she said.

John is now seven inches taller and regularly plays basketball and golf, activities that were unthinkable before his surgery. He's learning how to drive, too, and is currently a student at Nassau Community College on Long Island.

He isn't sure exactly what he wants to do when he graduates, but John dreams of being a doctor.

""Since I was helped as a child, I want to help children as they're growing up and dealing with their own situations,"" he said. And while he isn't picking up the scalpel just yet, John has some advice for those who might be struggling like he did.

""If you just stay positive,"" he said, ""and work through and deal with the pain of the situation, if you can just get through that, then there are going to be brighter days.""","Mon, 29 Oct 2018 21:52:57 GMT"

"Health officials search for answers in deadly New Jersey viral infection ","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180129122815-adenoviruses-super-tease.jpg"," Health officials continue to investigate after seven people died and at least 11 others have been infected with an adenovirus at a New Jersey health care facility, the New Jersey Department of Health said Wednesday.

This is up from the six deaths announced Tuesday among medically fragile children at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, New Jersey.

""They range in age from toddlers to young adults,"" New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal told reporters Wednesday. ""The vast majority are under the age of 18. Some have been hospitalized, and some are being cared for at this facility.""

The outbreak appears to be confined to the facility's respiratory unit, he added.

While the timing of the deaths remains unclear, the health department was notified of respiratory illness at the facility on October 9. The facility notified parents ten days later, on October 19, according to health department spokeswoman Nicole Kirgan.

""Health professionals and other people don't think of the common cold as being serious, but when you're a child, disabled, chronic disease, immunosuppressed, elderly, multiple medical conditions, the common cold can be life-threatening,"" said Dr. David Gifford, senior vice president of quality and regulatory affairs for the American Health Care Association.

The association -- whose member organizations represent nursing homes and other health care facilities across the country -- does not own or operate individual facilities. Though the Wanaque facility is a member of the national organization by default, Gifford said the association does not take positions to individually represent individual facilities.

Gifford said that the amount of time it takes to respond to a potential outbreak and notify families is variable. ""There are so many nuances,"" he said, including how long health experts need to investigate a potential outbreak, culture a virus and confirm its identity.

""Generally, if you're seeing a number of people in an institutional setting who have an illness, you start to take some precautions about the spread,"" said Gifford, but that may not necessarily include notifying families of something that initially resembles a common cold.

In a statement Tuesday, the Wanaque facility said it ""promptly notified all appropriate government agencies when the virus was initially identified."" On Wednesday, an additional statement by the facility said the health department ""continues to work very closely with the facility to ensure that all infection control measures are being followed.""

The facility did not respond to multiple calls and emails for further comment. It has been ""instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance,"" according to the state health department. According to Elnahal, the outbreak can only be declared over once four weeks pass without an additional case.

""Nursing homes don't call the health department that often,"" Gifford said, though there has been a push for nursing homes and health care facilities to get health departments involved in outbreak investigations earlier.

Adenoviruses are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments for long periods of time, may not be eliminated by common disinfectants, and rarely cause severe illness in healthy people. However, people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk for severe disease, and they may remain infectious long after they recover, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The strain of adenovirus seen in this outbreak is associated with communal living arrangements and known to cause severe illness,"" the state health department said.

""It can be difficult to impossible to know how the virus got to the facility, what its source was, or what its specific mechanism of spread is from person to person,"" Elnahal said. ""But we are working with the CDC on this ongoing outbreak investigation.""

The state health department said Tuesday that an inspection team at the facility on Sunday found minor handwashing deficiencies.

In a review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Wanaque Center was awarded an above-average ranking in overall quality but a below-average health inspection rating.

Based on an inspection conducted in August, CMS reported that ""it was determined that the facility failed to provide a clean and homelike physical environment for their residents."" The review found carpeted areas that ""smelled of old carpet and mildew.""

On Wednesday, Elnahal described these as ""low-level, self-limited deficiences"" that were subsequently resolved when health inspectors rechecked.

May 2017 inspection report ""determined that the facility failed to ensure infection control practices were followed."" Among the deficiencies cited were improperly stored syringes, which were used to measure liquid medication, and over-bed tables and medication trays that were not properly cleaned and disinfected. The deficiencies were listed as corrected a month later and were lower in number than the US average.

""It is rare that in any inspection a facility would come out with no citations,"" Elnahal said. ""If it's a number of citations, all of which are low-level, we ask for a plan of correction. We make sure the facility follows through -- and that's what this facility did here.""

""If the findings are severe enough to take further action, we will,"" he added.

Nurses at the facility had previously reported a shortage of nursing staff and supplies, according to a statement Tuesday from the union that represents the nursing staff. The Health Professionals and Allied Employees said the shortages may have led to ""poor infection control practices.""

The union said it represents the 70 nurses that work at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation.

'Hardy' viruses

Adenoviruses can cause mild to severe illness, though serious illness is less common. People with weakened immune systems or existing respiratory or cardiac disease are at higher risk of developing severe illness from an adenovirus infection, according to the CDC.

This outbreak, caused by adenovirus type 7, ""is affecting medically fragile children with severely compromised immune systems,"" the health department said Tuesday.

""Most of the time, adenoviruses produce influenza-like illness with cough and runny nose and feeling crummy, but you get better,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, previously told CNN.

She described this family of viruses as ""environmentally hardy.""

""Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face,"" she previously told CNN. ""That's kind of the easiest way to prevent inadvertently transporting something from your fingers into your nose or mouth.""

Adenovirus infections ""usually occur sporadically -- here a case, there a case -- so outbreaks are pretty rare,"" Schaffner said.

From 2003 through 2016, the two most commonly reported adenovirus types in the US were types 2 and 3, though four additional types -- 1, 4, 7 and 14 -- also caused illness, according to a 2017 report from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease of the CDC. These six types accounted for 85.5% of 1,497 laboratory-confirmed specimens reported during the time period.

This small number of cases is believed to be an underrepresentation of the actual number of cases due to the fact that most people who become sick either do not go to a doctor, or their doctors do not test for this virus.

And adenoviruses are still difficult to diagnose since they're not typically included in a panel of tests used to identify specific viruses, according to Schaffner. He said this is changing, and for that reason, he believes the number of cases will rise.

Still, Schaffner doesn't think people need to be worried about adenoviruses. ""They cause principally a whole bunch of minor troublesome infections spread by children, often from children to adults,"" he said.

""But they're not nearly as serious as influenza.""","Wed, 24 Oct 2018 23:29:23 GMT"

"Half of early deaths in the UK are due to lifestyle","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920100424-smoking-study-uk-super-tease.jpg"," Residents of the UK are twice as likely to die early if they live in deprived parts of England than the more affluent parts, a new analysis has revealed.

Rates of premature mortality were consistently higher in the 15 most deprived parts of the country compared to the 15 least deprived.

The new findings show that the leading cause of death in the UK was heart disease in 2016, with rates two times higher in men than women. Lung cancer came second and stroke was third.

Self-harm was the third leading cause of early deaths among men, according to the stud y published Wednesday.

Half of all early deaths across the country that same year were due to behavioral risk factors such as tobacco, bad diets, alcohol and drug use, obesity and high blood pressure.

The team of UK scientists behind the study hope the data will help policy makers manage resources and priorities to the level of burden and risk factors in different regions, with more appropriate interventions to improve diets and lower rates of smoking.

The analysis is based on data from the Global Burden of Disease estimates for the UK on years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years from 1990 to 2016 for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and 150 English Local Authorities.

This aim was to identify ""where are people dying younger than they should be"" and for what reasons, said Nicholas Steel, the study leader and a professor of public health at the University of East Anglia.

The analysis of 150 local authorities showed a ""startling disparity"" in premature deaths across the UK.

""I think we should all be concerned at the level of inequality that still exists across the UK,"" Steel told CNN.

'Stubborn health gap between rich and poor'

Previous evidence has shown that more deprived areas have higher rates of smoking or alcohol use. Professor John Newton at Public Health England, who contributed to the study, explained that the underlying reasons for higher risk factors in those parts of the country are linked to people's experience as children, their education, opportunities to have healthy work, housing quality and access to green spaces.

""There's a whole range of things that lie behind the easy targets of smoking and obesity,"" said Newton.

But some areas with the same level of deprivation showed different outcomes. London's borough of Tower Hamlets, for example, had better health outcomes than other areas with similar conditions, like the city of Liverpool in the north of the country, identifying the need for city-specific actions to respond to the problem.

Northern Ireland had particularly high rates of anxiety disorders, which the authors believe stem from the country's legacy of conflict. Premature mortality was also higher in Scotland than in England.

Another new finding researchers noted was the ""big shift of morbidity"" -- conditions that won't kill but cause a lot of suffering, such as mental health problems, back and neck pain. These were previously not treated as a priority by the UK's National Health Service explained Steel, ""but this new information suggests they should be.""

The leading causes of ill health in 2016 were low back and neck pain, skin and subcutaneous diseases, migraine, and depressive disorders, the study found.

These conditions ""are huge causes of disability in the UK,"" said Steel.

Newton highlighted the ever-increasing impact of living with poor health. ""As we work to develop the NHS long term plan, actions tackling the social and structural drivers of ill health are needed if we're to improve the stubborn health gap between rich and poor areas of the country,"" he said.

Global slow down

Between the period of 1990 to 2016 British life expectancy improved, but the rate of this started slowing down from 2010 onwards. The study suggests this is due to a slower rate of improvement since 2010 in some causes of death, such as heart diseases, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.

Steel highlighted that the slow-down in health improvement since 2010 is a global problem, particularly affecting the USA, which he said had the ""biggest problem"" in health improvement.

""Nearly all European countries have a similar problem. This is an international picture of year on year improvements in life expectancy stalling around 2010 and 2011,"" he explained.

Newton stated that globally the UK is doing ""very well"" but compared to its peers it is ranked in the middle of the pack. ""Our progress seems to be slipping back a little,"" he said, adding that some reasons for this are poor outcomes in respiratory diseases and some cancers like lung cancer.

Opportunity to improve

The ten biggest causes of premature death -- including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, obesity, alcohol, drug use, low physical activity, and environmental factors, such as air pollution -- ranked similarly across the UK.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

The ""opportunity to prevent these problems is huge,"" said Newton. ""What this study has done is quantify the opportunity of prevention and it's really quite staggering.""

Newton explained that Public Health England will be able to create more coordinated and effective strategies to deal with these problems thanks to the data examining local health outcomes.

On a national level Newton believes there is a lot to be done on tobacco control and reformulating the nation's diet to contain healthier foods.

With regard to the rise in morbidity, Newton said, ""if we can improve that, that would make a huge difference"" to people's lives and to lessen the burden on the UK's health care services.","Thu, 25 Oct 2018 09:57:47 GMT"

"Generation Z reported the most mental health problems","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180420124514-10-school-walkouts-0420-dc-super-tease.jpg"," Many members of Generation Z -- young people between 15 and 21 -- have taken more active roles in political activism this year, and a new survey indicates that the state of the nation is to blame for this generation's stress levels.

As gun violence, sexual assault claims and immigration dominate the 2018 news cycle, the American Psychological Association's annual Stress in America survey says that such issues are the main cause of stress among young adults.

The survey, released Tuesday, was conducted among 3,459 people 18 and older, and it included interviews with 300 teenagers ages 15 to 17. It measures attitudes and perception of stress to identify the leading sources of stress among the general public.

School safety is a top concern

Gun violence is the top source of stress across all generations, the survey said. About 75% of Gen Z reported mass shootings as a significant source of stress, and 72% said the same about school shootings.

school say they experience stress when considering the possibility of a school shooting, About 56% of those who are inschool say they experience stress when considering the possibility of a school shooting, the survey says.

School shootings are also a top concern for parents, the survey says, as 74% fear one or the possibility of one.

In comparison, 73% of millennials who took the survey stress about school shootings and 69% about mass shootings. As for Gen Xers and baby boomers, 58% expressed concern over mass shootings, and about the same percentage stress over school shootings.

School security measures have helped reduce stress levels in 37% of students interviewed, but 22% feel that the measures have increased their stress levels; 41% say that they have not affected their stress levels, the report adds.

""The pressures facing Generation Z are different from those that faced older generations at the same age. For example, mass shootings simply did not happen with the same scale and frequency when I was in school,"" said Arthur Evans, a psychologist and CEO of the American Psychological Association.

This is the 12th year the association has conducted the stress survey as part of its Mind/Body Health Campaign, and it's the first year the survey has asked about gun violence, spokeswoman Sophie Bethune said.

Stressed about the country

In order to direct the association's focus on Gen Z, Evans said, it added questions on a range of issues such as immigration, climate change, rising suicide rates and reports of sexual harassment or abuse.

Sixty-eight percent of people between the ages 18 and 21 expressed concern for the state of the nation, but the study found this generation to be least likely to run to the polls in November, with just 54% saying they will vote.

The survey says that number is well below the overall average of 7 in 10 adults from all generations who plan to vote in the 2018 midterm elections.

Still, 57% of Gen Z believed the cases of separation and deportation of immigrant families in the United States to be a significant source of stress, in comparison to 45% of adults overall.

Widespread reports of sexual harassment or abuse have also played a big role in the young adults' stress levels, as 53% blamed this issue for their stress. Only 39% of adults overall say the same.

As for climate change, 58% of Gen Z says it's a significant source of stress, in comparison with 51% of adults overall.

Evans attributes these results to the fact that certain regions of a young adult's brain are still maturing and have not developed enough to handle stress the same way adults do.

""While young people are facing many of the same issues that older adults face, they have not yet had the life experiences that many older adults have had, such as practice responding to and coping with a broad range of stressors,"" he said.

Reporting a mental problem

Although 62% of Generation Z said rising suicide rates are also a source of stress, compared with 44% of adults overall, the survey says these young people are more likely to report mental health conditions than any other generation.

About 37% of young adults reported receiving help or treatment from mental health professionals, and half feel that they do enough to manage their stress.

Only 35% of millennials, 26% of Gen Xers and 22% of baby boomers reported to receiving help, treatment or therapy for mental health.

""The fact that more Gen Z individuals than adults in other generations said that they thought their mental health was fair or poor is concerning,"" Evans said. ""However, this could also be interpreted as a positive sign. This generation may be more tuned in to recognizing issues with their mental health than older generations.""

The report says that public figures' openness about their mental health challenges could be a reason why this generation is speaking out more, and their use of social media could be another key factor.

""It's clear that social media is an enormous part of Gen Zs' lives, and for more than half of them (55%), it provides a feeling of support,"" the report says.

But social media also plays a negative role, the report claims; 45% said they feel judged on the social platforms, and 38% reported feeling bad about themselves due to the use of social media.

One positive outcome in the report was that 75% of the overall participants said they feel hopeful about their future.

""We hope that people understand that channeling tension, feelings of dissatisfaction and uncertainty toward something that is meaningful and productive is a healthy approach to managing stress,"" Evans said. ""Taking active steps to address your concerns can lessen feelings of stress.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:10:00 GMT"

"Fake drugs: The global industry putting your life at risk","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141119084658-pills-stock-story-top.jpg","In late 2012, 60 people died in two cities in Pakistan after drinking cough syrup to get high. Tests in Pakistan revealed that the medicines seemed to contain the correct amount of active ingredient, but further tests revealed something that was not supposed to be there. Levomethorphan, a chemical five times stronger than morphine, was the contaminant that had caused the deaths.

In September 2013, 44 children in Paraguay were admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties. It turned out the children had all been given a locally made cough medicine, and investigators later found that this came from the same batch that had caused the deaths in Pakistan.

Doctors in Paraguay were able to administer an antidote and save the children. A World Health Organization alert went out listing the batches from the Indian factory that might be contaminated. By then the ingredient had been transported to multiple countries in Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. It had already been made into cough medicines in Colombia and Peru, but these were recalled before they could reach patients. The batch that went to the Middle East could not be traced.

In this case, a blatantly poor-quality medicine was detected because its effects were conspicuous. A more discreet kind of substandard medicine -- say, an antibiotic without enough active ingredient -- probably stands a strong chance of reaching patients across the world without getting discovered.

This is a story of how the manufacture and distribution of medicines today is such a complex, globalised affair that it is often hard to track where fake or substandard medicines come from and where they go. This is a story of how these medicines could make you ill or even kill you, even if you don't take them.

Substandards and fakes

The term ""poor-quality medicines"" is something of a catch-all. It includes ""substandards"", medicines that have had inadequate quality control or that have degraded from improper storage or the passage of time. And it includes falsified medicines -- fakes -- that claim to be what they are not. These may not be made by the manufacturer whose name is on the package, and they may not contain the stated ingredients in the stated quantities.

Poor-quality medicines might not work. Like those peddled by Peter Gillespie, who was jailed for introducing 72,000 packets of falsified medicines into the UK's distribution system from 2006 to 2007. 25,000 packets reached pharmacies and were given to patients. These knock-off tablets were used to treat heart disease, pancreatic cancer and mental illnesses, and had none or only part of the active ingredient they were supposed to contain. This meant that those people's illnesses were left to take their course.

Poor-quality medicines can kill you if you take them. As happened with Thomas Rybinski, a 56-year-old autoworker from Tennessee, USA, who got an injection for his back pain in 2012. He fell ill and died because the medicine had contaminants that caused fungal meningitis. The batch of medicine, originating in a New England pharmacy with close to no quality control, ended up causing severe infections in nearly 800 people across the USA, killing 64 of them.

Poor-quality medicines can kill you even if you don't take them. Antimicrobial drugs (including antibiotics and antivirals) that have too little active ingredient are generally accepted to help disease-causing bugs evolve so that they develop resistance to treatment even with good-quality antimicrobials. And then these bugs spread.

With some drugs, like statins or arthritis drugs, the effects of poor quality are confined to those taking them. But with antimicrobials, inappropriate use reduces their effectiveness for everyone else.

The factors that speed up the development of antimicrobial resistance -- high rates of infections, the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, poor sanitation, poor-quality medicines -- are more common in low- and middle-income countries, which means that so is resistance. But microbes know no boundaries, and they travel easily across the world, in foodstuffs being exported and in the bodies of humans. And often, resistant microbes can transfer genetic material to each other to become even more dangerous to humans.

The result: infections that were simple to cure, gonorrhoea for example, are back with a vengeance. Conditions like tuberculosis and HIV are getting harder to treat. In the future, routine surgery or cancer treatment could become risky. There is a real danger of returning to a time where any one of us, anywhere in the world, could pick up such an infection and find that medicine is powerless to save us from dying.

A global network

At a south Indian restaurant in Delhi, I meet Suresh Sati. He is a large middle-aged man, often larger-than-life in his enthusiasm, who has spent a considerable part of his working life as a private investigator exposing manufacturers of falsified medicines.

Within 15 minutes of sitting down, he has produced so many samples of fake medicines that our tumblers of coffee risk being crowded off the table. He collected them over years of investigations, from raids or from informants in fake medicine distribution networks.

India is one of the largest exporters of generic medicines in the world. Forty per cent of over-the-counter and prescription generics sold in the USA come from India. In the UK, a quarter of all generics come from India, and generics account for 80 per cent of National Health Service prescriptions.

Yet India's pharmaceutical sector is indifferently regulated, and Indian pharmaceutical companies have been pulled up by foreign trading partners for exporting substandard or contaminated medicines.

Sati points at one of the boxes in front of him, a ten-strip cardboard container of Zifi 200 -- a trade name for the antibiotic cefixime, used for throat infections, urinary tract infections and gonorrhoea. ""Now the monsoons are beginning, and people are going to start falling ill. This sells the most. Every doctor is going to prescribe Zifi 200,"" he says. That makes it a popular target for the fakers.

I ask if I can take a photograph of the packaging. He hands me two of the Zifi 200 strips and tells me to keep them. ""There'll be more coming my way,"" he says. The strips even include verification codes to be sent by SMS to check if the medicine is real. I make a note to buy a strip from a pharmacy to compare with the fakes.

Sati tells me how he once purchased a batch of 100,000 common painkillers from a fakes manufacturer in Sonepat. After his medicine was ready, Sati burnt the lot and had the manufacturer raided; he was told he would be shot if he was ever seen again in that town.

An important step while getting fakes made, Sati says, is a question that the manufacturer asks: ""Which do you want? Full-salt, half-salt or chalk-mitti?"" That is, fakes with the stated amount of active ingredient, with only some of the active ingredient, or just chalk dust. Each has a different price.

According to Sati, the practice of adding a fraction of active ingredient to fakes began to be seen in India around 15 years ago, as drug controllers and consumers began to realise that there were fake medicines in the system. Manufacturers of fakes saw it as a way to protect themselves, as the medicines might have some effect and draw less attention. And if they were caught, it allowed them to claim that it was a case of production error rather than outright fakery.

While this might work well for the manufacturers, it is bad for the patients -- who receive sub-therapuetic doses, too low to properly treat their illnesses -- and terrible from the perspective of antimicrobial resistance.

""Sub-therapeutic dosing, by definition, contributes to antimicrobial resistance,"" says Elizabeth Pisani, an epidemiologist and a visiting senior research fellow at the Policy Institute, King's College London. ""Bugs are mutating all the time,"" she explains. Some of these mutations make the bugs slightly more resistant to drug treatment, but the mutants are usually at a disadvantage among non-mutants because it takes them more energy to reproduce.

Our antimicrobials work most effectively against the non-mutant versions, but a full therapeutic dose further ensures that slightly resistant versions are eliminated too. However, if you have only a fraction of the active ingredient, it's going to knock out the susceptible ones first and there might not be enough left over to knock out the slightly resistant ones. ""That creates elbow room for the slightly resistant ones to reproduce because the competition has been wiped out,"" says Pisani ""And that's how a mutant version becomes a dominant strain.""

Pisani suspects that poor-quality medicines are a significant contributor to antimicrobial resistance. But while laboratory studies, modelling and common sense all point to the link between poor-quality medicine and resistance, it would be hard to study directly in humans. As Pisani puts it, ""The way we would normally test those things is in a large human trial, and we can't actually give people crap medicines, right?""

Ensuring medicine quality is a global challenge. A pill might be manufactured from ingredients sourced from multiple countries, shipped via several ports, packaged and repackaged in various countries and ultimately sold via an internet pharmacy. The number of points at which fakes or substandards could enter the chain is staggering, so international coordination is essential.

A good starting point is the WHO database of substandard and falsified medical products, which helped identify the batch of cough syrup administered to children in Paraguay. But a crucial tool is regulation, the responsibility for which could be shared better. Pisani explains, ""Right now, it's an entirely globalised industry that we're trying to regulate locally.""

In Delhi, Suresh Sati is sceptical of the Indian government's attempts to regulate poor-quality medicines at a local level. In 2009, the health minister introduced a scheme to reward whistle-blowers who alerted regulators about quality problems. ""Not a single person has come forward,"" Sati says. He also believes the laws and their enforcement are lax and no one really pays the price for making fake drugs.

""The margin from selling fake medicines is more than from selling heroin. With heroin you're scared of the police, but here you're not."" And so those who run fake medicine operations continue to do so with relative impunity. One of them even warned Sati that if he persisted with his investigations he would be dissolved in a boiler, a threat that few are in a better position to make convincingly than the kingpin of a fake medicine racket.

Putting drugs to the test

In 2010, Indians consumed the most antibiotics per person in the world. Medicines, including antimicrobials, are easily available over the counter despite rules that forbid this. A study published in 2018 found that a large number of antibiotics were on sale without being approved either in India or in the country of the manufacturer.

To preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials, regulators need to prevent their overuse and misuse just as they need to prevent the use of poor-quality fakes.

The fake tablets that Sati gave me, Zifi 200, should contain cefixime as their active ingredient. Cefixime is classified as a third-generation cephalosporin, which is on the WHO's list of critically important antimicrobials, and within it is categorised as ""Highest Priority"". Cefixime is also on a list of drugs in India called Schedule H1, a classification introduced by the government in 2014 to regulate access to drugs, specifically as a counter to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. A Schedule H1 drug can only be sold against a prescription, and the pharmacist is required to maintain a record of the sale, the prescribing doctor and contact information for the patient.

Some medicines, including Zifi 200, use an SMS verification service to combat fakes. Text the code and you soon get a reply to say if your medicine is genuine or not.

I sent off a text message with the code on one of the strips Sati gave me. As expected, it failed. Later, I went down to a pharmacy to see if I could buy a strip of Zifi 200. The pharmacist, with dismaying cheerfulness, handed me a strip without asking for a prescription or recording the sale. This one passed verification. There I was with two identical strips of tablets -- one that was fake and should never have been made, and one that lacked a prescription and should never have been sold.","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 08:33:35 GMT"

"Dogs can sniff out malaria parasites on your clothes","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181029113734-04-malaria-sniffing-dogs-research-intl-super-tease.jpg","The animals were trained to identify whether someone was infected with malaria simply by sniffing their socks, according to the research, published Monday.

Dogs have been trained to use smell to diagnose some forms of cancer and diabetes , and now, UK scientists have helped train two dogs to detect malaria parasites, aided by the British organization Medical Detection Dogs

""People carrying malaria parasite already have a signature scent, and we know if dogs can smell drugs, food and other substances, they should be able to detect this smell on clothing, too,"" said Steve Lindsay, a public health entomologist at in the Department of Biosciences at Durham University and lead investigator on the study.

Lindsay's team trialed their idea in Gambia, where they collected socks given to 600 schoolchildren ages 5 to 13 who did or did not have malaria. The socks were used to train the dogs in the UK over four months.

""We took the socks that had captured the scent of the children overnight and flew them to the UK, where the dogs were trained to smell and differentiate samples that were infected or not,"" Lindsay said.

Of the samples, 175 were used to train the dogs: 30 from children infected with malaria and 145 from uninfected children.

Freya, a springer spaniel who has been trained to detect malaria parasites in socks from children in Gambia.

By smelling the socks alone, the dogs -- Lexi, a Labrador-golden retriever, and Sally, a Lab -- were able to accurately detect 70% of infected children and 90% of uninfected children.

The study shows that dogs can be deployed as tools for malaria detection, as they have in the diagnosis of some forms of cancer, according to the researchers.

Dogs have millions of sensors in their noses that make them more sensitive to odors than humans are.

But more research is needed after this pilot study, and the authors warn that the method is still in the early trial stages. They would need to test the technique on samples from other countries before the animals can be used in the field, they said.

Further studies also need to be done, especially in African countries, to see whether dogs can ""directly"" sniff out malaria in infected people, the team said.

Detection rates could have been higher -- up to 78% -- if the children with malaria had the same type of malaria parasites, they added.

There were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria globally in 2016, including 445,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The disease can be treated, but there is no preventive vaccine.

The researchers believe their findings could be useful in detecting malaria in people showing no signs of fever, a common symptom, therefore preventing its spread, particularly in countries that have eliminated the disease. Identification would also help people get treated early with antimalarial drugs.

""It is useful in countries like South Africa, close to elimination, or Sri Lanka, that has eliminated malaria. How do you locate that one person in a million people carrying the parasite in a country that has recorded no infection without doing invasive tests?"" Lindsay said.

The method may not be effective in endemic countries such as Nigeria, where malaria is actively transmitted, Lindsay said.

""The dogs are good in countries where they are going to zero infections or where they where they are malaria-free, and you have to prevent people from bringing malaria into the country ... through the airport or the ports.""

Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs, said she is excited by the results. It is first time the charity has trained dogs to detect a parasite infection, though its dogs have helped in canine cancer and diabetes detection. A dog named Freya has been trained to detect malaria since the initial study.

She said the results offer the potential that dogs serve as cost-effective tools in the diagnosis of tropical diseases, especially in areas where they are lacking.

""I believe that this study indicates that dogs have an excellent ability to detect malaria and if presented within an individual infected with the parasite or a piece of recently worn clothing, their accuracy levels will be extremely high. This is a reliable, non-invasive test and is extremely exciting for the future,"" Guest said.","Mon, 29 Oct 2018 16:32:03 GMT"

"How to evade the leading cause of death in the United States","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181027100441-unintentional-injuries-health-super-tease.jpg"," Americans are afraid of a lot of things: public speaking, heights, snakes, clowns and flying, just to name a few. Only some of these things can kill you, and none of them are likely to.

When it comes to flying, you've probably heard this before: You're more likely to die from a lightning strike than in a plane crash. It's true . You're also more likely to die from being attacked by a dog, stung by a bee or choking on your food.

But chances are you haven't thought too much about the leading cause of death for people in the United States ages 1 to 44 : unintentional injury. In 2016 (the latest year for which data is available), 61,749 people in that age group died as a result of an unintentional injury, nearly twice as many as from cancer and heart disease combined. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these deaths were predominantly a result of motor vehicle accidents and unintentional poisonings.

The good news is that there are some simple things you can do to avoid becoming an unintentional injury statistic, and they start right in your own home.

Basic safety at home

The US Fire Administration estimates there were 364,000 residential fires in 2016, the majority of which occurred while someone was cooking. That year, 2,775 people died in residential fires; 11,025 people were injured; and monetary losses totaled more than $5.7 billion.

Laws vary from city to city, county to county, and state to state, but even in places where they are not legally required, the Fire Administration recommends you ""install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each separate sleeping area, and on every level of the home, including the basement.""

You should test all of the smoke alarms in your house once a month, and if they have removable batteries (usually 9V), you should replace them once a year. If your smoke detectors have built-in, long-lasting lithium-ion batteries, they should be good for at least 10 years. But no matter which type you have, a loud chirping sound means you should replace a dying battery as soon as possible, before you forget to do it.

Carbon monoxide detectors are another priceless piece of safety equipment to install in your home, either in addition to, or in combination with, your smoke alarms. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can be dangerous -- even fatal -- in an enclosed space, such as your house.

Carbon monoxide ""is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces,"" according to the CDC

It's important to make sure all of your indoor appliances are functioning properly -- notably, that they are not leaking -- and that outdoor appliances are only used outdoors. Experts especially implore homeowners to not use generators indoors when their power goes out. Never use a gas stove or oven to heat your home. And always ensure your chimneys are clear.

Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, according to the CDC, are often described as ""flu-like"" and can include headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach and vomiting.

Lastly, it's a good idea to keep at least one fire extinguisher in your house, ideally in the kitchen, because that is where most home fires ignite. Check your fire extinguisher regularly to make sure it's ""charged"" properly. That means the little needle on the gauge should be in the green.

Basic safety on the road

Every year, more than 32,000 people are killed and 2 million more are injured in motor vehicle accidents on US roadways, according to the CDC . In addition to never driving drunk or exceeding the posted speed limit, seat belts also play a major role in saving lives every day.

The CDC urges drivers and passengers to ""use a seat belt in every seat, on every trip, no matter how short."" It also stresses the importance of choosing the appropriate type of car seat for children, based on their age, height and weight.

The CDC recommends children sit in the back seat, in a rear facing car seat, until about age 2. Then, they can sit in the back seat, in a forward-facing car seat, until ""at least"" age 5.

""Once children outgrow their forward-facing seat, they should be buckled in a booster seat until seat belts fit properly,"" the CDC says. ""Proper seat belt fit usually occurs when children are 4 feet 9 inches tall and age 9-12.""

No child should sit in the front seat of car or truck until they turn 13.

""One of the biggest problems for this generation is texting and driving,"" says CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta . ""There's been plenty of evidence to show how much you can divert your attention just by looking at your phone for a split second, and how long you can actually travel during that time.""

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), ""Sending or receiving a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed.""

The agency says 3,450 people died as a result of distracted driving, which includes texting and driving, in 2016.

Laws regarding using a cell phone while driving vary from state to state, but anything that takes your attention off the road is always dangerous, even if it is not illegal.

""Your best bet is to do something I've started doing myself, which is to just put the phone out of reach, in the glove compartment or even in the trunk,"" says Gupta. ""Those calls, texts and emails can all wait until you get where you're going.""

Basic safety on your bike

Biking can be excellent exercise, whether you do it inside or out. If you do choose to bike outdoors, you need to know the rules of the road in order to stay safe.

According to the NHTSA , 840 bicyclists were killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2016. The highest fatality rate was documented in Florida, with 6.7 deaths per 1 million people that year.

Before you hop on your bike, make sure it's in good working condition; that the seat and handlebars are tightened, the tires are properly inflated, and the brakes are functioning as they should. At a bare minimum, you should have a white reflector on the front of your bike and a red reflector on the back. If you ever ride at night, consider adding lights to your bike, in both the front and the back, to increase visibility.

You should always wear clothing that makes you stand out, especially when riding after dark. Bright colors -- even reflective gear -- could mean the difference between a driver seeing you, or not. Cyclists also suggest tucking your right pant leg into your sock and your shoelaces into your shoe, so they don't get caught in your bike chain.

Without question, the most important piece of safety equipment when you ride is a helmet. The NHTSA stresses the importance of a proper fit, and refers consumers to the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute for in-depth guidance. (This website is frequently updated, despite a retro look that harkens back to the early days of the internet.)

Always ride on the same side of the road and in the same direction as traffic. Obey all of the same signs, signals as road markings as you would if you were driving. Keep your eyes on the road and watch out for obstacles that might cause you to skid, swerve or fall.

While you probably heard most of this advice from your parents growing up, it does bear repeating, because they were right -- at least when it comes to basic safety.","Mon, 29 Oct 2018 17:53:32 GMT"

"Halloween-time traditions around the world","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181025215649-01-halloween-around-the-world-super-tease.jpg"," In the United States, it's that time of year when children dress in costume and parade the neighborhood, asking for sugary treats. Families may share scary stories around a bonfire, or curl up with popcorn to watch horror movies.

Halloween is upon us, with more than 175 million Americans planning to partake in festivities this year, according to the National Retail Federation

Yet in other countries around the world, there are some very different celebrations that occur during the last week of October or first days of November.

Parenting Without Borders considers how parenting trends and methods differ -- or don't -- around the world.

""Halloween is pretty much a North American holiday, as we celebrate it now,"" said Regina Hansen, a master lecturer at Boston University's College of General Studies , who has expertise in Halloween-related practices throughout history and popular culture.

""There are countries that have All Saints' celebrations or Day of the Dead or All Souls Day type of celebrations that are not Halloween,"" she said. ""They are different things that happen to occur at the same time.""

As American children delight in Halloween celebrations, here is just a sampling of some other fall festivities that families may be engaging in around the world.

Remembering ancestors and lives lost

""The mid-point between summer, in a general sense, and winter is a time traditionally associated with the remembrance of the dead in many cultures,"" said Joseph Nagy, a professor in Harvard University's Department of Celtic Languages and Literature in Boston, who has expertise in folklore and mythology.

Around the same time as Halloween, some families in Mexico gather to remember deceased friends and family members for a holiday known as el DÃ­a de los Muertos , or Day of the Dead, on November 2nd . Celebrations typically begin two days before.

In Haiti, Day of the Dead is sometimes celebrated with various Vodou rituals and customs

Before Halloween, typically in August, some families in China celebrate the Hungry Ghost Festival , a month-long ancient tradition that pays respect to the spirits of the dead on the seventh month of the lunar calendar.

During the festival, ghosts are believed to return to Earth to haunt the living and people burn paper money, food and incense to pay respect to their ancestors and soothe wandering spirits. Throughout the month, many communities host celebrations, hand out rice to people in need and stage traditional Chinese operas on temporary bamboo stages.

On the first day of November, some families worldwide, from France to Guatemala, celebrate All Saints' Day, a Christian festival typically marked with family gatherings and silent prayers to honor all of the saints.

Pope Gregory III built and dedicated a special chapel in Rome in the 8th century in memory of all the saints on November 1, according to the Catholic University of America . Then Pope Gregory IV and Emperor Louis the Pious extended the November 1 feast of All Saints to the Holy Roman Empire in the 9th century, and from there it spread throughout Europe.

In medieval England, the festival was known as All Hallows , and its eve is All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween. The day after All Saints' Day is All Souls' Day on November 2. These days were designated as a celebration of saints and a time to pray for dead souls.

During this time in France, for instance, ""people may go to cemeteries and they wear a flower to honor their departed relatives,"" Hansen said, referring to chrysanthemums

Meanwhile, in Guatemala, some families honor their dead by flying large, colorful, hand-painted kites in the sky over the graves of family members.

As it turns out, even where the idea of Halloween is believed to have originated -- in western Europe -- some celebrations involved honoring the dead.

Halloween's spooky origins

""Probably the first thing we have that is related to Halloween is this Irish Celtic festival known as Samhain , which occurred at the end of October and this is often thought of as a new year celebration,"" Hansen said.

The word Halloween is an abbreviated version of the phrases All Hallows' Eve or All Hallows' Evening, but the celebration is believed to have come from that ancient festival celebrated by Celtic people more than 2,000 years ago.

""What we would call November, or the early part of it, appears to have been the designated end-of-harvest and beginning-of-winter time among peoples who spoke or speak Celtic languages -- primarily represented today by the Irish, the Scottish particularly of the Highlands and islands, the Welsh, and the Bretons -- but the Celtic languages were far more widespread throughout Europe in ancient times,"" Nagy said.

""In Irish, this time or, specifically, what we would call November 1, is known as Samhain, which probably means 'end of summer,' "" he said. ""This time was, and still to some extent is, treated in the traditional cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Brittany as 'liminal' -- that is, a time when boundaries both human and metaphysical loosen up.""

While it remains unclear exactly how ancient Celtic people celebrated Samhain, due to there not being many written records, Hansen had some ideas.

""They probably had bonfires ... and made offerings of food and crops and cattle,"" Hansen said, since research suggests that is typically how they tended to celebrate things.

""It was when the Irish immigrants came that the holiday really sort of took root in America and they had their practice of going door to door, asking for fruits and nuts and things like that,"" she said, referring to how immigrants from Ireland and Scotland brought Halloween-like traditions to the US in the 1800s.

Then over time, she added, Halloween became more commercialized and evolved into the candy-fueled celebration it is today, not only in the US but other countries too.

"13 of the scariest health risks of Halloween","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181022190311-01-halloween-dangers-super-tease.jpg"," Americans go batty for Halloween. We're not afraid to dig deep to have a howling good time.

We're planning on spending $9 billion on the holiday, according to the National Retail Federation's annual survey.

Dressing up as spooks and monsters, such those in Fortnite (this year's most popular costume), will gobble up $3.2 billion in temporary apparel without even a bloodcurdling scream. Ghoulish decorations will slurp up another $2.7 billion, while candy will drain a mere $2.6 billion from ourveins lives.

What's truly petrifying: The very items we purchase to have a frightfully fun holiday can help maim (or even kill) us and our loved ones if not used with caution.

Don't say we didn't warn you.

1. Deadly day for kids

The statistics are shocking. Children are twice as likely to die on Halloween than any other day of the year as they trick-or-treat along our streets. That's according to a 2012 State Farm analysis of more than 4 million fatalities between 1990 and 2010.

An older study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was even scarier: Children were four times more likely to die on All Hallows' Eve while walking.

More than a quarter of the deaths occurred between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m., State Farm found, with 70% happening in the middle of the block, away from a crosswalk or intersection.

Parents should make sure their child's costume sports reflective tape, and kids should carry a flashlight or glow stick. Children should not trick-or-treat alone, but in groups with parental supervision. Even then, parents need to be on guard: Excited children can easily sprint ahead and forget to look both ways.

These fatalities are not just among little kids, either. Most of the pedestrian deaths occurred among those between ages 12 and 15, followed by ages 5 to 8. Young people should be cautioned about the distractions of cell phone use and follow other safety guidelines, including use of flashlights.

2. Killer buzz

So who is responsible for most of those pedestrian deaths? You guessed it -- drivers who drank or partied too much. And you don't have to ""feel"" drunk or stoned to be impaired. As the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says: ""Buzzed driving is drunk driving.""

NHTSA statistics show that during a four-year period, 14% of all pedestrian deaths on Halloween involved drunken drivers. Overall, the agency says Halloween drunk-driving fatalities are on the rise, with 44% of all people killed in car crashes on Halloween night involving a drunk driver.

Sadly, young adult drivers aged 15 to 25 were responsible for the majority of pedestrian deaths of children, according to the State Farm analysis. Safety experts suggest keeping young, inexperienced drivers off the road on Halloween, and of course, be alert for signs of alcohol abuse.

3. Demon allergies

One in 13 children under the age of 18 in the United States has food allergies. Chances are high one of those kids will visit your house for a treat.

Milk, eggs, peanuts, soy, wheat, tree nuts, fish and shellfish are responsible for 90% of allergic reactions, according to the Food Allergy Research and Education group. Some of those reactions can be deadly.

Many candies are off limits for children, either because they contain one of the top allergens or because of the danger of cross contamination.

To meet the needs of all your trick-or-treaters, you can join the Teal Pumpkin project , which suggests having non-food treats on hand, such as glow sticks, bubbles, stickers or markers. Then hang a teal pumpkin outside your home so kids with allergies will know you are allergy-safe.

4. Fire hazards

Even if you're dressed as the devil, you don't want to burn. Yet fire hazards abound on Halloween, as people use sandbag candles and fiery jack-o'-lanterns to decorate their homes and walkways.

That won't stop them from burning, says the By law, all costumes, wigs, masks and other accessories sold in the US are required to be made of flame-resistant materials. You'll know they are if they are labeled ""flame resistant.""That won't stop them from burning, says the Consumer Product Safety Commission , but they will be easier to extinguish once removed from the fire source.

If you make your costume, be sure to use flame-resistant cloth as well. Nylon and polyester are good choices. If you use more flammable materials such as cotton, add a fire-retardant spray to the costume and all of its bits and pieces.

Too much trouble? There's a startling video produced by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service in the United Kingdom where children's costumes are still considered toys and making them fire-resistant is voluntary for manufacturers. While dramatic music plays, a suited-up firefighter lights child's costume after costume. Within seconds, each costume bursts into flames and is consumed within minutes.

""If your child is wearing one of these costumes, keep them away from naked flames,"" the video suggests before it ends. Use battery-powered candles to reduce the risk, the video suggests.

5. Revenge of the jack-o'-lantern

Pumpkin carving takes the lead each year over other Halloween injuries, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. Out of an estimated 4,500 Halloween related injuries reported during October and November last year, 41% were related to pumpkin carving.

Safety experts suggest putting the sharp kitchen knives aside and using only the small pumpkin carving tools that come in kits, which are designed to minimize injuries.

Be careful when carving your pumpkin this Halloween. pic.twitter.com/UOrDdA1djb â US Consumer Product Safety Commission (@USCPSC) October 3, 2018

6. Trick or trip

Tripping or falling wins second place for most common Halloween injury, says the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Getting tangled in the long legs of ill-fitting costumes is a key reason; costume masks can also be part of the problem.

Many gruesome monster heads are ill-fitting, with poorly cut eye holes that limit vision. Ghostly sheets can both obstruct eyesight and become tripping hazards. Be sure whatever you wear or put on your kids will allow full range of eyesight and has been altered to prevent tripping before you head out the door.

Experts also suggest using face paint (carefully) instead of masks for better vision. Another tip: Never ride your bike or skateboard or skate wearing a costume.

7. Falling down on the job

In addition to tripping, falling off a ladder or other height ties for second most common injury during Halloween, says the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Most occur while putting up or taking down Halloween decorations, most likely because of poor ladder safety skills.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission devotes an entire page to Ladder Safety 101. Some of the highlights:

Choose a ladder with slip-resistant feet that extends at least 3 feet over the roofline.

Place it on firm and level ground. If it's not, buy leg levelers at the hardware store.

Make sure the ladder can support your weight and have a helper hold it at the bottom.

Don't use a metal ladder near any power lines or electrical equipment.

8. Pokes in the eye

What's a pirate without a sword? Luke Skywalker without his lightsaber? Harry Potter without his wand?

Your child (and the child in you) will likely push back if you try to limit accessorizing that special Halloween outfit, but be aware of the dangers. Just like sticks, pointed props such as swords, spears and wands can poke out the eyes of excited children (or adults) gathered too close.

Considering that falls account for nearly a third of all Halloween-related injuries, that pointy object could just as easily end up in your child's eye, or someone else's.

Safety experts suggest trying to purchase softer, more flexible versions of a necessary prop for a safe, but stylish Halloween.

9. Out-of-this-world eyes

Your outfit demands ""creature-of-the-underworld"" eyes to make it suitably eerie. And you've found some cheap costume contacts online that would work perfectly.

Before you plop those into your eyes, beware: They could contain chlorine, iron and other harmful chemicals, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology

Many of the decorative contacts sold online and in gas stations and beauty parlors are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They could easily contain harmful colorants used to create tints and patterns on the surface of the lens. A study in Japan, where decorative contacts are popular, found those chemicals could remain even after rinsing with water.

The lens-making process can also leave uneven, scratchy surfaces that might not be visible but could scratch your cornea. Germs could then enter and infect the eye, creating scarring that can damage vision and cause blindness.

To drive home the dangers, the American Academy of Ophthalmology shares the story of Julian Hamlin, who at 17 ruined his eyes with $20 over-the-counter contacts. Ten surgeries later, he's still blind in one eye, and continues to suffer from eye infections and glaucoma in the other.

10. Beware of face paint

Don't turn that clown smile upside-down. Check how your skin will react to face paint before you slather your face with it. Applying a small bit on your arm a day or two before could save a lot of scratching, swelling, redness and embarrassment if you end up being allergic, the FDA advises.

The FDA does approve color additives in face paint and theatrical makeup and creates rules about where they should be applied on the body. A color that's OK for hair or nails, it says, might not be good for the skin.

To be sure if a Halloween makeup is safe, the FDA suggests checking the Summary of Color Additives on their website. If the color on the label of the product isn't on their list, ""the company that made it is not obeying the law. Don't use it,"" warns the agency.

11. There goes the dental work

As the American Dental Association says: ""Be picky if it's sticky."" Caramels, taffy, gummies and other chewy candies stick to the teeth longer, contributing to cavities, but they are also notorious for pulling out fillings and crowns. Sticky, gummy candy and braces? What a tangled web you'd weave with that.

On the opposite end, hard candies can also be bad for your teeth. They also last longer in the mouth, contributing to decay, and you can break a tooth if you chomp down too hard. Hard candies can also damage brackets and other appliances that hold braces together.

What do dentists recommend? Chocolate is good because it's soft and leaves the mouth rather quickly. Just be sure to brush and floss.

Another tip: Eat Halloween candy just after meals. Saliva production increases during meals and helps rinse away food particles and bacteria, the ADA says.

12. Careful with candy

Nine out of 10 Americans believe chocolate and candy make Halloween more fun, according to a survey released by the National Confectioners Association . And since Americans are expected to dish out 2.6 billion dollars on candy this year, we certainly plan to have a LOT of fun.

Of course, that means a LOT of extra calories. Even ""fun size"" candies, which have become the standard Halloween giveaway, contain a deceptively high calorie count, considering their tiny size.

Take fun-size M&Ms. A bag of originals contains 73 calories. Add peanuts and it's 90 calories. There are 80 calories each in Twix, Almond Joy, Milky Way and Snickers fun size bars; Butterfinger and Baby Ruth have 85. Fun size Skittles have 60 calories. And that favorite nibble, candy corn, is seven calories ... each. But who eats just one?

So if one candy splurge consisted of one of each of the candies above, plus about 30 candy corns, you'll have taken in 923 fun-sized calories.

To burn off that really fun time, you'd have to do about three hours of walking, biking, dancing or golf, or about 4.5 hours of light weight training. Having a blast yet?

13. A deadly snack for Fido or Fluffy

Halloween candy can be deadly for your dog or cat. No candy is healthy, but anything that's sugar-free, or contains raisins or chocolate can quickly cause seizures, even organ failure.

""Pets are 32% more likely to experience food poisoning during Halloween week,"" said Cara Meglio, content and communications manager for Petplan, a pet insurance company.

It can be all too easy for your pet to sneak a snack while your children inspect their haul, so be sure to put your furry friend in another room before bringing out the sweet stuff.

If pets do get hold of raisins, sugar-free candy or chocolate , call your vet immediately. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has a poison hot line, too: (888) 426-4435.

If poisoned, your pet might need his or her stomach pumped. According to Petplan, the average cost of treatment for food poisoning last year was $730.17, but can easily rise to $1,100 or more depending on the severity of the poisoning and any complications.

Pet costumes are a growing trend, especially among millennials, says the National Retail Federation's annual survey. Choose costumes that aren't too restrictive, especially around the throat, say vets, and beware of loose costume bits that can be chewed off and swallowed.

Those, along with lollipop sticks, glow sticks and foil or cellophane wrappers can create digestive blockages you might not notice for days. In 2017 the average cost of surgical removal of a foreign object lodged in the intestines of a pet was $2,062.13. ""As with food poisoning cases, more severe or complicated occurrences can cost much more,"" said Petplan's Meglio.","Fri, 26 Oct 2018 10:07:33 GMT"

"Can coffee really sober you up?","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150813184422-10-coffee-health-super-tease.jpg"," You're out late at night and you've had one too many drinks. You're feeling a bit inebriated, and you're wondering if a cup of coffee can help. Many of us have been there.

Well, here's the lowdown: While a cup of joe or shot of espresso can help to perk you up, it's not going to help sober you up. In fact, in some situations, the combination of caffeine and alcohol could be potentially harmful.

""I call it the 'perfect storm,' "" said Dr. Mary Claire O'Brien, senior associate dean for health care education at the Wake Forest School of Medicine, who has researched the interactions between caffeine and alcohol, including its effects on injury risk.

How alcohol and caffeine are metabolized

Caffeine is a stimulant, so it can make you more alert and possibly improve your performance to some extent, according to Dr. Robert Swift, associate director of the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addition Studies. Specifically, caffeine interferes with the action of a chemical known as adenosine. ""Adenosine tends to be sedative ... and one of the signals to fall asleep is that adenosine builds up in the brain,"" Swift said. By blocking the action of adenosine, caffeine has the ability to make you feel less tired, Swift explained.

Interestingly, alcohol can trigger the release of dopamine, which results in a stimulant effect when you first start drinking, though this does not necessarily mean you are any less impaired from alcohol, according to Swift.

Alcohol's sedative effects tend to kick in after blood alcohol levels peak and then start to fall. Specifically, alcohol promotes the release of the brain chemical GABA, which produces sedation, Swift explained. Alcohol also blocks the action of glutamate, a brain chemical that stimulates nerve cells, and this blockade can also produce sedation. During this time, you might feel tired, and in need of a pick-me-up.

Alcohol and caffeine: A potentially dangerous combination

Consuming caffeine might make you feel less sleepy when drinking alcohol, but it will not accelerate alcohol metabolism or ameliorate its effects, experts say. Mixing the two is also a practice that the US Dietary Guidelines cautions against

A major concern when seeking out coffee or any source of caffeine in an effort to feel awake after a few drinks, is that by making you feel less tired, you may think you are less inebriated than you actually are.

""Even if someone feels like the caffeine causes them to feel more awake and less sluggish, they still need to be aware that the alcohol is still metabolizing in the same way and on the same timeframe as if they haven't had any caffeine ... which means that its effects can still be potentially dangerous,"" said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

""Someone may think, 'I can drive now' ... they see a car stop suddenly, and they have to put their foot on the brake quickly, but reaction time could be slow,"" Swift said. ""What you feel is [linked to] a different part of your brain that is the motor system that controls reaction time.""

""Your blood alcohol concentration won't be reversed by caffeine,"" Swift added. That means people feel less tired from alcohol when they drink coffee, ""but they are not any less impaired,"" Swift explained.

In one study involving close to 130 adult drinkers, alcohol negatively affected reaction time and resulted in more crashes during a simulated driving test, but drinking caffeinated beer didn't improve people's ability to drive

In addition to the fact that consuming caffeine while drinking won't make you any sharper behind the wheel, there also is no evidence that consuming caffeine while drinking would improve your judgment in social situations, according to Swift.

What's more, by making you feel less tired or sedated, you may be inclined to consume more alcohol than you otherwise would. ""If you take caffeine with your alcohol, people drink more,"" Swift said. ""The usual signal where people would say 'I've had enough' is no longer there.""

""Caffeine permits you to stay awake longer than you would have otherwise -- and therefore drink for a longer amount of time,"" O'Brien added. ""I had the experience of taking care of a young man who was extremely intoxicated, and almost on a ventilator ... he said had been drinking Red Bull and JÃ¤germeister. When I asked why he was mixing alcohol and caffeine, he said, 'So I can stay drunk longer,' "" O'Brien said.

The marketing and sale of premixed beverages containing alcohol and caffeine has been particularly concerning among experts. But there has been a positive outcome: O'Brien's research examining injury associated with these caffeinated malt beverages (dubbed ""AEDs, or ""alcoholic energy drinks"") contributed to the successful removal of these beverages from the market in 2010.

""The FDA put the kibosh on that, because of the negative public health implications,"" Swift said.

Strategies for sobering up

Experts say the only way to sober up is to let time pass. The specific time it will take for alcohol to leave your system depends on the individual, but on average, people metabolize about one drink per hour. ""If you've had five drinks, it would take about five hours to get the alcohol totally out of your system,"" Swift said.

But an even better strategy is to prevent intoxication in the first place. Experts say drinking with food in your stomach can slow the rise of alcohol in your bloodstream, which can make you less impaired than if you drank on an empty stomach.

Alternating alcoholic beverages with seltzer or water is another helpful strategy. It won't slow the absorption of alcohol in the body or make you less inebriated, but ""water will help keep one hydrated ... and can potentially decrease the amount of alcohol someone drinks,"" Majumdar said.","Fri, 26 Oct 2018 09:58:58 GMT"

"He spent 30 years shining shoes -- and raised more than $200,000 for sick kids","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181025113414-03--alberts-kids-donations-super-tease.jpg"," Every Tuesday and Thursday, Albert Lexie shined shoes at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

He did this every week, for 30 years.

He died earlier this month at age 76. What makes Lexie's story so remarkable is what he did with the money he collected in tips.

He donated them all to a fund that helped sick kids. More than $200,000

""I think Albert is a symbol of philanthropy and generosity,"" Chris Gessner, the hospital president, told CNN. ""He's the kind of special person that people hope for in the world.""

He charged $3 for a shine

Lexie began shining shoes at the Pittsburgh hospital in 1982.

Twice a week, he left his home at 5:50 a.m. and rode the bus to Pittsburgh from his small town of Monessen, Pennsylvania -- roughly a two-hour journey.

He charged $3 for a shine. He didn't make much -- $10,000 a year -- but he sent his tips to the Free Care Fund. The fund helps uninsured or underinsured children receive medical care they need.

He was 'singularly focused'

Gessner, the hospital president, says he first met Lexie 18 years ago when he walked into an almost entirely shoeless meeting.

""I noticed half the people were all without shoes. When I asked what's going on, they said, ""It's Albert. He's out in the hallway cleaning shoes.""

""He was singularly focused on helping sick kids,"" Gessner added. ""He stuck to business. He was a personably, happy man, but he was very focused on shining shoes to help the kids.""

He was widely recognized for his generosity

Lexie was awarded the Jefferson Medal for Outstanding Citizen in 1997, the Outstanding Philanthropist Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals in 2001 and the National Caring Award by the Caring Institute in 2006. In 2010, Lexie was one of 30 honorees in the 2010 Major League Baseball's ""All-Stars Among Us.""

"Tall people at greater risk of cancer, study says","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024072814-tall-and-short-person-stock-super-tease.jpg"," Tall people are at a greater risk of cancer because they have more cells in their body, new research has suggested.

A person's risk of developing cancer increases by 10% for every 10 centimeters (4 inches) they are over the average height, the study said, because they have more cells which could mutate and lead to cancer.

Average height was defined in the study as 162cm (5 feet, 4 inches) for women and 175cm (5 feet, 9 inches) for men.

The findings match with previous research, which has also connected height to an increased risk of developing a range of health problems including blood clots, heart problems and diabetes.

Leonard Nunney, a professor of biology at the University of California Riverside, analyzed previous sets of data on people who had contracted cancer -- each of which included more than 10,000 cases for both men and women -- and compared the figures with anticipated rates based on their height.

He tested the hypothesis that this was due to the number of cells against alternatives, such as possible hormonal differences in taller people, which could lead to an increased rate of cell division.

A link was found between a person's total cell number and their likelihood of contracting cancer in 18 of the 23 cancers tested for, the study says.

The research also found that the increase in risk is greater for women, with taller women 12% more likely to contract cancer and taller men 9% more likely to do so. Those findings matched with Nunney's predicted rates, using his models, of 13% for women and 11% for men.

Colon and kidney cancer and lymphoma were among the types of cancer for which the correlation was strongest.

""We've known that there is a link between cancer risk and height for quite a long time -- the taller someone is, the higher the cancer risk,"" Georgina Hill from Cancer Research UK told CNN.

""What we haven't been sure of is why -- whether this is simply because a taller person has more cells in their body, or whether there's an indirect link, such as something to do with nutrition and childhood,"" added Hill, who was not involved in the study.

She said the study provides good evidence of the ""direct effect"" theory that the total number of cells does indeed cause the link.

""The methodology is good - they took data from large studies, which is important, and they looked at lots of different categories of cancer.""

But she noted that the increase in risk of developing cancer is small compared to the effects that lifestyle changes can have.

""It was only a slightly higher risk and that there are more important actions that people can take to make positive changes, [such as] stopping smoking and maintaining a healthy weight,"" she said.

Two of the types of cancer tested for, thyroid cancer and melanoma, were found to be more susceptible to an increase in risk than expected, and Nunney suggested in the study that other factors could be at play in those cases, such as geography.

""There are no obvious reasons for these exceptions, although the author speculates that cell turnover rates may come into play for melanoma,"" Dorothy C. Bennett, director of the Molecular and Clinical Sciences Research Institute in London told CNN. Bennett, who was not involved in the study, explained that pigment cells, the source of melanoma, divide and are replaced a little faster in taller people.

""But I cannot at present think of any reason why this [faster division] should be so, but nor any other clear reason for the higher correlation with height,"" Bennett said.","Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:29:54 GMT"

"Gender inequality linked to deaths of girls under 5","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181030130727-01-gender-inequality-protest103018-super-tease.jpg"," In countries where women face more unequal treatment in society, young girls have a lower chance of survival, a new analysis finds.

Gender inequality is linked to more deaths than expected among girls under the age of 5 compared with boys of the same age, especially in lower- and middle-income countries, says the study , published Tuesday.

Girls have a statistic, perhaps evolutionary, advantage over to boys when it comes to survival. This seems to exist through women's childbearing ages, said lead researcher Valentina Gallo, professor of epidemiology at Queen Mary University of London's Centre for Primary Care and Public Health.

But the study shows that in settings in which sexist attitudes value boys more than girls, this advantage is reduced and a greater proportion of girls are dying, fueled by reduced access to basic health care and more exposure to health risks, such as female genital mutilation. In India, for example, the rates of vaccinating girls are lower than in boys.

The team analyzed gender inequality levels and sex-specific child mortality rates in 195 countries using UNICEF's database of child mortality worldwide and the UN's Gender Inequality Index , which measures gender inequality based on reproductive health, female empowerment and economic status.

""These girls are also further exposed to this risk via their mothers, who may themselves be penalized and valued less than mothers of sons and less able to provide for their daughters,"" Gallo said.

Using statistical models, the team explored the association between a country's male to female ratio of under-5 child mortality rates -- which shows the probability of deaths per 1,000 live births by sex -- and gender inequality. They found a strong correlation between low levels of equality and more young girls dying than they should, Gallo said.

But other experts warn against claiming causation from such correlations and say more research is needed.

how this impacts girls and boys separately. Research has shown that countries with higher infant mortality also experienced more gender discrimination, but this study is the first to examinehow this impacts girls and boys separately.

""We are not sure we can generalize these findings. However, at [a] country level, the highest gender inequality led to more girls dying,"" Gallo said.

Removing an evolutionary advantage

Worldwide, more boys are dying than girls, but low to middle-income countries were found to have a smaller difference -- a lower male to female child mortality ratio -- meaning that more girls are dying. This in turn correlated with the countries that had greater gender inequality.

Sarah Hawkes, professor of global public health at University College London and director of the university's Centre for Gender and Global Health, says this advantage has been known since the 17th century.

""The study highlights a few things we have been pushing for in global health research and policies for some time now,"" said Hawkes, who was not involved in the study.

It is not possible to estimate a natural or ideal rate for the male to female child mortality ratio, Gallo said, but this study found that the ratio varies from 0.8 to 1.4, with a majority of countries having a rate of 1.2, equaling 120 boys dying for every 100 girls.

The higher the gender inequality index, the lower the sex ratio for children under the age of 5 dying. This means that in the world's least-gender-equal societies -- like Yemen, which scored the lowest score out of the 195 countries -- more girls than expected were dying than boys under the age of 5.

India and Tonga are outliers, as their male to female ratio is less than one, so more girls than boys are dying in total, Gallo explained. ""There is clearly a problem."" Both countries ranked among the lowest for gender equality, with Tonga in the bottom 10.

""It is surprising that [gender inequality] is so strongly associated with mortality. There is something going on that makes girls severely more discriminated than boys in many regions in the world,"" Gallo said.

'Can't infer causation from correlations'

The study is a snapshot of gender in the countries examined, but ""health statistics 101 will tell you, you can't infer causation from correlations,"" Hawkes warned. Gallo's team also stressed the need for more research so definitive causal links can be drawn between gender and mortality for under five.

The paper's authors also note that many studies point toward lower-income countries reporting disproportionately fewer female deaths, with families being less likely to record female deaths.

Alexandra Rolland, sexual and reproductive health and rights policy adviser for the charity Plan International, mentioned that the data collected could be incomplete, meaning the actual picture of young girls dying could be worse than the study is demonstrating. ""We know that there are a lot of children who's birth isn't registered,"" Rolland added.

In these countries, it is important to note that parents don't love their daughters less, she explained. ""It means that [their] limited income will be spent toward boys,"" rather than girls.

Hawkes highlighted that this study fits into a growing body of evidence that gender is a large determinant of health across all ages and needs to be taken seriously in policy responses. ""Data captures sex,"" Hawkes said. ""But gender is about what it means to be a boy or a girl in any society.""

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

In 2015, 5.9 million children around the globe died before they turned 5. Some of the factors for these young deaths, besides gender, are being born in rural areas, in poor households or to mothers denied basic education. Rolland stresses that the numbers talk about human beings ""whose lives are completely unnecessarily cut short.""

The paper's authors noted that their analysis should show the need to address gender inequality not only in terms of health but in the field of women's political empowerment, participation in the workforce and education.

Because a society's ideas about different expectations and roles for men and women, Gallo thinks there needs to be a sort of revolution ""from inside, prompted by both men and women to change the mentality.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:30:21 GMT"

"A 5-year-old boy tested positive for meth after trick or treating. And it wasn't from the candy","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181030113213-halloween-candy-stock-103018-super-tease.jpg"," Tainted candy on Halloween night is the scariest part of the holiday for parents. Tainted fake teeth? Not so much a concern.

Well, not usually.

A 5-year-old boy in Galion, Ohio, tested positive for methaphetamine this week after trick-or-treating. But the boy said he hadn't put anything else in his mouth besides a pair of fake vampire teeth.

The Galion Police Department said in a statement they began investigating after a report that the boy had fallen sick on Sunday. They have sent the teeth to a lab for analysis.

Julia Pence, the boy's mother, said she rushed to the hospital after hearing he had a seizure.

""He was disoriented, he didn't know who was who and where he was at,"" Pence told CNN. ""They told me that my son had methamphetamine in his urine.""

And then they asked if the boy had been trick-or-treating.

""You could tell at the hospital that he was real high from whatever he ingested,"" she said. ""He was really wired and kind of aggressive, had different mood swings. When we came home he was real tired, he was coming down from it.""

But before you throw out your child's spooky Dracula accessories, know that police are calling this a rare occurrence.

""This is an oddity,"" Galion Police Chief Brian Saterfield told CNN. ""This is not something that happens all the time.""

"Neanderthals might not be the hunched cavemen we thought they were, study says","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181030110959-02-ancient-finds-103018-super-tease.jpg"," Neanderthals may not have sported the barrel-chested bodies and hunched posture we see in museums and textbooks, according to a new study.

The first 3D virtual reconstruction of a Neanderthal ribcage has revealed that they had straighter spines and a greater lung capacity than modern humans. The findings about the Neanderthal, also spelled Neandertal, were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications

""Neandertals are closely related to us with complex cultural adaptations much like those of modern humans, but their physical form is different from us in important ways,"" said Patricia Kramer, corresponding study author and professor in the University of Washington department of anthropology. ""Understanding their adaptations allows us to understand our own evolutionary path better.""

The skeleton, first uncovered in 1983 in Israel's Kebara Cave, is considered to be the most complete Neanderthal remains to date -- although it's missing a cranium. In life, the male Neanderthal, known as Kebara 2 or K2, stood around 5 1/2 feet tall and weighed 166 pounds. He walked the Earth 60,000 years ago and died at 32 years of age.

Kebara 2 is one of several Neanderthal remains recovered from this cave.

Researchers from Spain, Israel and the United States worked together on the study. ""Three continents, three languages, one fascination with how the world worked for our shared ancestors,"" Kramer said.

The international team of researchers used CT scans of K2's fossils to recreate a 3D model of his chest and focused on reconstructing the thorax. The thorax comprises the rib cage and upper spine, forming a cavity that houses the lungs and heart.

These rare Neanderthal bones are typically fragile, and it's easier and less risky to assemble them using a virtual method.

""The shape of the thorax is key to understanding how Neandertals moved in their environment because it informs us about their breathing and balance,"" said Asier Gomez-Olivencia, lead study author and Ikerbasque Fellow at the University of the Basque Country.

The Neanderthal thorax has actually been the subject of debate among scientists for years due to the stereotypical view of ""hunched-over cavemen"" based on studies from the 19th and 20th centuries.

The researchers used scientific 3D software, medical scans of the skeleton and direct observations of the K2 skeleton, currently at Tel Aviv University, to piece together their ancient puzzle.

""This was meticulous work,"" said Alon Barash, a co-author of the study and lecturer at Israel's Bar Ilan University. ""We had to CT scan each vertebra and all of the ribs fragments individually and then reassemble them in 3D.""

They also compared the medical scans of the bones along with those of modern adult men.

A virtual reconstruction of Kebara 2.

The completed puzzle revealed that Neanderthal ribs connected to the spine more inwardly, which forces the chest cavity out and causes the spine to tilt back. The result is a spinal column that lacks the lumbar curve of modern humans.

""I am really curious about how the straightness of the Neandertal lower back, combined with the shape of the ribcage, impacts forces in the lower spine and pelvis,"" Kramer said. ""Modern humans and the other hominins that preserve this region have a lumbar curve but not Neandertals. Why? As a structural engineer and functional morphologist, these questions of shapes connected to behaviors fascinate me.""

The researchers called this difference ""striking."" This skeletal structure not only provided Neanderthals with more stability, but allowed for a larger diaphragm and more lung capacity.

""The wide lower thorax of Neandertals and the horizontal orientation of the ribs suggest that Neandertals relied more on their diaphragm for breathing,"" said Ella Been, study co-author and physical therapist at Ono Academic College. ""Modern humans, on the other hand, rely both on the diaphragm and on the expansion of the rib cage for breathing. Here we see how new technologies in the study of fossil remains is providing new information to understand extinct species.""

The researchers have no reason to believe that this is specific to the Neanderthal skeleton they studied because these traits are shared by other Neanderthal bones that have been analyzed.

But it opens up new questions as to why Neanderthals had such a different skeletal structure. Perhaps they needed a larger lung capacity to survive climate change, support their large body masses and support a rugged hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

""The study that I am most interested in pursuing is what this difference in the body shape means for how Neandertals moved around in their world,"" Kramer said. ""Mobility is a fundamental aspect of an individual's life, as anyone who has ever had an injury to their lower body or limbs knows, so I can't help but wonder what this information will allow us to learn about how they walked, how they carried their possessions and their babies, how their groups moved on foraging trips and who went along in the group, and where they might have travelled.""

The 3D modeling used in the study could open up this field of research. If Kramer could apply it to any fossil, she said she would love to virtually reconstruct the famed Lucy fossil

""Having a virtual reconstruction allows us to do all sorts of new computer modeling,"" Kramer said. ""For me, though, the most exciting piece is thinking about the impact of a differently shaped body on mobility. With the computer models, we can begin to 'reanimate' them to see how they moved on hills, for instance, or how carrying burdens impacted their movements.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 16:02:00 GMT"

"Dating while you have an STD","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120110035855-online-dating-couple-hands-laptop-story-top.jpg"," Dating someone new is about checking out the new restaurant on the block or taking a hot yoga class together. And in the age of safer sex, it also means sharing information about your sexual health.

It's a conversation that people with sexually transmitted diseases or STDs, also referred to as sexually transmitted infections or STIs -- such as herpes, chlamydia or HIV -- have been having for years. Meanwhile, their numbers are growing. Today, an estimated 1 in 2 sexually active Americans will contract an STD by the time they turn 25

But has dating when you have one gotten easier?

""The stigma associated with having an STI leads folks to believe that they won't be able to date and that no one will want to have sex with them, but in my experience, that's rarely the case,"" said Jenelle Marie Pierce, executive director of the STD Project and spokeswoman for PositiveSingles.com, a dating website aimed at people with STDs. ""Sure, some people experience rejection after disclosing to a new partner. But most people find that the stigma itself is far worse than the infection.""

I asked Pierce and other experts to share more insights on dating when you have an STD.

When should you tell a potential partner that you have an STD?

""When first dating someone, most people want to put their best foot forward and disclose information about themselves over time and as comfort, trust and feelings develop,"" sex therapist Diane Gleim said. ""Depending on your preference and your feelings about the person you're dating, you may want to lead with your STI status or not. Either approach is OK, but not disclosing your status as sexual activity becomes clearly imminent is not OK.""

In other words, you don't need to have this conversation on your first date (unless you want to), but you should absolutely tell your partner before you become sexually intimate with them.

""It's super important to make your STI status known prior to having sex with someone new,"" sex educator Heather Alberda said. ""Setting the stage for healthy communication starts on day one.""

Josh Robbins, an HIV/AIDS activist and spokesman for another dating website, DatingPositives.com, said that ""all you can do is be safe. Being safe means taking personal responsibility and getting tested regularly in order to be up to date on the status of your health.""

""But it's also about being honest about your sexual health, and the longer you wait to tell someone you're positive, the harder it will be. Sadly, there may be people who are too afraid to admit they have a condition because they fear rejection. That fear comes from stigma, which can only be reduced by educating people and accepting as a society that STIs are very, very common.""

How should you tell a potential partner about your STD status?

It's best to approach the conversation pragmatically and succinctly in a safe space with few distractions, Pierce said. ""Give the person space and let them take a day or two to circle back with questions. And try your best not to take their response personally.""

And for people with STDs who want to skip the uncomfortable conversation -- and get right to all the other wonderfully awkward aspects of dating -- websites like PositiveSingles.com and DatingPositives.com offer a way to do just that. ""When folks are initially diagnosed, they are absolutely petrified of disclosing to a new partner, if they even want to date at all, so sometimes, a dating site can really help,"" Pierce explained.

Sex therapist Rachel Needle offers this advice: ""First, make sure you tell them in person, face-to-face. Be prepared to educate your partner about the STI you have, including ways you can be sexually active and reduce the chance of transmission. If you feel comfortable, you can share with them how you contracted the STI and how, if at all, it has impacted you. Allow your partner to ask any questions they have and provide them with good resources to learn more on their own.'

What should someone expect when disclosing STD status?

""People who have long-term STIs always expect the worst when disclosing their status, but I want to challenge them to also only accept the best,"" Pierce said. ""While everyone isn't going to be excited that you have an STI, a calm, kind and thoughtful response is what should happen when you disclose to a new person. If they are hysterical, cruel or disrespectful, then walk away.""

Robbins agreed. ""I've found that refusing to pursue someone's approval or acceptance of my chronic condition is the way to go,"" he explained. ""Attempting to validate myself through another person's acceptance is pointless. Instead, I view being open about my journey as a privilege I extend to a potential partner. Their reaction will determine whether or not I want them to be in my life.""

The sex educator known as Laureen HD added that ""potential partners tend to ask 'what happened?' after you disclose that you have an STI. And a common mistake -- at least, I consider it a mistake -- that people with herpes make is to feel that they owe potential partners an explanation on how they contracted herpes, as if contracting it from a cheating boyfriend versus from a one night stand makes a difference.

I did an experiment where I used Tinder for a month, where the only thing my bio read was 'I have genital herpes, swipe right only if you're cool with it.' I didn't know what to expect, but my fearful self, brainwashed by the stigma, anticipated that there was going to be a lot of slut-shaming or rude interactions. But none of that happened. Most guys who swiped right were genuinely appreciative of how upfront I was about the information, and a few were even down to meet up and get to know each other in person. This taught me that we are more understanding of STIs in the privacy of our relationships than we are in public conversations.""

What should people without STDs know about dating someone who's positive?

Many people may just assume that they're negative and have not been tested for STDs. The experts I contacted point out that someone who knows that they have an STD is more likely to be aware of their sexual health. ""People who are openly STD-positive are the people you should least fear,"" Robbins said. ""It's the people who say they're negative -- but maybe they're only assumed negative or maybe they've just never been tested -- who actually pose the most risk.""

It's also worth educating yourself about that risk. ""A once-daily preventive medication called PrEP is now available for people who are in a relationship with someone who is HIV-positive,"" Alberda said. ""We also know now that if viral loads are undetectable, HIV is unable to be passed along to a partner.""

Sex therapist Michael Vigorito explained, ""Studies show a decrease in HIV infections associated with two medical advances: taking a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for those who are HIV negative and 'undetectable = untransmittable' for those who are positive. My clients share that these interventions decrease their anxieties about HIV infection or transmission and allow them to enjoy their sexuality more fully.""

It's clear that having an STD doesn't have to put an end to dating or sex. Just like safe sex, it's one more topic you'll want to discuss with a new partner before getting intimate.

""When I got diagnosed with genital herpes, which is an incurable STI, it felt like going back to teenage years and having to learn how to date all over again,"" Laureen HD said. ""How to make myself look approachable without coming off as easy or promiscuous, how to build self-confidence to put myself out there again, how to not fall for the first person who would fall for me in light of my disclosure, etc.

""After my first rejection, I remember thinking, 'That's it, I won't ever be able to be in a relationship anymore. I won't ever be a wife. I won't ever be a mom.' Those fears and insecurities even lead me to neglect letting some partners know of my diagnosis in a timely way. But a lot of trial and error later, I figured I would rather be rejected while having done the right thing than accepted but having neglected their consent. The emotional fragility never vanishes completely, even after getting many positive responses.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 09:50:19 GMT"

"Global wildlife populations have fallen by 60% in 40 years","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170215142848-polar-bear-super-tease.jpg"," Global wildlife populations have fallen by 60% in just over four decades, as accelerating pollution, deforestation, climate change and other manmade factors have created a ""mindblowing"" crisis, the World Wildlife Fund has warned in a damning new report.

The total numbers of more than 4,000 mammal, bird, fish, reptile and amphibian species declined rapidly between 1970 and 2014, the Living Planet Report 2018 says.

Current rates of species extinction are now up to 1,000 times higher than before human involvement in animal ecosystems became a factor.

The proportion of the planet's land that is free from human impact is projected to drop from a quarter to a tenth by 2050, as habitat removal, hunting, pollution, disease and climate change continue to spread, the organization added.

The group has called for an international treaty, modeled on the Paris climate agreement, to be drafted to protect wildlife and reverse human impacts on nature.

It warned that current efforts to protect the natural world are not keeping up with the speed of manmade destruction.

The crisis is ""unprecedented in its speed, in its scale and because it is single-handed,"" said Marco Lambertini, the WWF's director general. ""It's mindblowing. ... We're talking about 40 years. It's not even a blink of an eye compared to the history of life on Earth.""

""Now that we have the power to control and even damage nature, we continue to (use) it as if we were the hunters and gatherers of 20,000 years ago, with the technology of the 21st century,"" he added. ""We're still taking nature for granted, and it has to stop.""

WWF UK Chief Executive Tanya Steele added in a statement, ""We are the first generation to know we are destroying our planet and the last one that can do anything about it.""

The report also found that 90% of seabirds have plastics in their stomachs, compared with 5% in 1960, while about half of the world's shallow-water corals have been lost in the past three decades.

Animal life dropped the most rapidly in tropical areas of Latin America and the Caribbean, with an 89% fall in populations since 1970, while species that rely on freshwater habitats, like frogs and river fish, declined in population by 83%.

Methods of destruction

The report outlines the various ways in which human activities have led to losses in animal populations.

Species highlighted include African elephants, which declined in number in Tanzania by 60% in just five years between 2009 and 2014, mainly due to ivory poaching.

Deforestation in Borneo, designed to make way for timber and palm oil plantations, led to the loss of 100,000 orangutans between 1999 and 2015, the report estimated.

And the number of polar bears is expected to decline by 30% by 2050 as global warming causes Arctic ice to melt, making their habitats increasingly precarious.

Wildlife is not just ""nice to have,"" the report said, warning that human health, food and medicine supplies, as well as global financial stability, are all damaged by declines in wildlife and nature.

The welfare of up to 3 billion people who rely on wildlife to eat and work has reduced because of land degradation, and services relying on nature are worth around $125 trillion globally, the report said.

""The collapse of wildlife populations over the last half-century is a shocking measure of humanity's impact on our planet,"" John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said in response to the report, joining WWF in calling for ""urgent action from world leaders.""

""From the decline of orangutans due to deforestation for palm oil to the ruinous impact of climate change on Arctic habitats to plastic pollution destroying marine wildlife, we cannot continue with business as usual,"" he added.

'A global deal'

International action is needed over the next two years in order to stem the tide of natural destruction, the organization noted, urging world governments and businesses to strike a deal similar to the 2016 Paris agreement for climate change.

""If we want a world with orangutans and puffins, clean air and enough food for everyone, we need urgent action from our leaders and a new global deal for nature and people that kick starts a global program of recovery,"" Steele said in her statement.

The WWF has urged the 196 member nations of the Convention on Biological Diversity to consider a range of targets when they meet in Egypt in late November.

It also encouraged a deal to be struck at the 75th United Nations General Assembly in 2020.

The group is pushing for ""a target that should be equivalent to the 2 degrees target (to limit global temperature rises) of the Paris agreement, and we still have to work out what the target is,"" Lambertini said.

""There is a limit to what we can destroy, and there is a minimum amount of nature that we need to preserve,"" Lambertini added, noting in the study that the international community has a ""rapidly closing window for action.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 12:43:31 GMT"

""I chose to join the case because it sounded like something I could actually do,"" said Nick Venner, photographed in 2016 at age 15, from Lakewood, Colorado. ""I think we have a really good chance of winning. It's hard for legal experts to deny the rights of young people. We are the future. They will be long gone before the long-term effects (of climate change) ever hit them. It's about my kids. It's about their grandkids.""

After years of hearings, a trial date had been set for October 29.

But 10 days before trial, the US Supreme Court issued a stay that has temporarily halted proceedings. The court is considering the federal government's petition for writ of mandamus, which the Department of Justice describes as an ""extraordinary remedy"" that should be used in ""exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.""

Federal attorneys are questioning whether the kids have a right to ""a climate system capable of sustaining human life"" under the Constitution or public trust doctrine. They say federal authorities will waste time and money by responding to what they call ""baseless claims."" And they argue in court filings it's a violation of the separation of powers to ask courts essentially to impose climate-change policy on federal officials, rather than waiting for Congress or other elected officials to do that.

""In our view, the Oregon lawsuit is an unconstitutional attempt to use a single court to control the entire nation's energy and climate policy,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey H. Wood said during an October 19 speech in San Diego . ""It is a matter of separation of powers and preserving the opportunity in our system of government for those policies to be decided by the elected branches, not the courts.

""... Beyond the legal defects,"" he added, ""the fallacies of the plaintiffs' policy approaches are significant, as well. They are ignoring the clear fact that the United States is the global leader in environmental protection. Indeed, the United States leads the world in greenhouse gas reductions, and the United States is the global leader in the development of new energy technologies that are helping to reduce emissions.""

US courts already have denied similar legal maneuvers aimed at halting the proceeding of the climate kids' case, said Mary Wood, a law professor at the University of Oregon. It's unclear when the Supreme Court will rule or what the outcome could be, she said. The ""barrage of petitions"" aiming to stop the kids ""clearly show the administration is worried about what will come out at trial,"" Wood said by phone. ""And they're just taking desperate measures to avoid a trial. It's changed the story. What are they trying to hide?""

The Department of Justice declined a CNN request for comment.

The petitions are described by supporters as an attempt to ""silence"" these kids, who claim that younger people have more to lose in the climate crisis because they'll be living with it longer.

""Our world is burning in front of our eyes, and what Juliana [v. United States] tells us is that our children know it,"" Garrett Epps, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore, wrote in The Atlantic, claiming the government is ""trying to silence"" the young plaintiffs. ""The government fears these 21 children; it asks the Supreme Court to tell them they do not even deserve a chance to fail"" in court.

""Let this youth group be heard! Let the experts testify! Let the court's doors be opened!"" Philip Gregory, one of the attorneys for the young people shouted to a crowd of supporters at the courthouse rally in Oregon. ""This is not just the 'trial of the century,' this is the trial for the future of this century.""

More than 60 support rallies were planned across the country on Monday, according to organizers. The lawsuit is funded by the nonprofit Our Children's Trust, based in Eugene, Oregon, which also has filed climate change lawsuits in other jurisdictions.

Supporters see the kids' suit as one of the most sweeping court challenges to US climate policy. The plaintiffs allege they are being discriminated against as young people, because they've done little to cause global warming but will suffer its effects disproportionally as they live into the climate-changed future. They claim federal agencies are violating their constitutional rights to ""life, liberty and property"" by pursuing actions that promote fossil fuel use. They also claim the federal government is violating public trust doctrine by allowing the pollution of the atmosphere, endangering young people and future generations.

""This case is a shining example of what law can be,"" Rick Reibstein, a lecturer in environmental law at Boston University, wrote on the American Bar Association's website . ""This case gives me hope that we will not continue to cooperate in our own destruction, and future generations will be able to rely on us to uphold the spirit of the law and purpose behind government.""

It's important the kids and their attorneys can make these arguments in court, Michael B. Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School in New York, told CNN before the temporary stay was issued. ""This will be a very rare opportunity for the public to see the science underlying climate change -- not merely asserted or disputed but closely examined in the crucible of cross-examination,"" he said by phone. ""Courtrooms tend to be no-BS zones.""

Gerrard and the Sabin Center have been tracking climate change lawsuits in the United States and around the world. As governments fail to cut emissions fast enough to avoid dangerous climate change, attorneys increasingly are seeking action from governments and the fossil fuel companies themselves. The kids' climate suit asks the courts to force the federal government to make a plan that will result in a livable atmosphere for future generations. Other cases seek damages associated with the expense of dealing with a climate-changed world, including sea walls and other expensive infrastructure used to dampen the effects of warming.

Some but certainly not all of the cases have been successful. An environmental group in The Netherlands, for example, sued the Dutch government on behalf of citizens. The court ordered the country to limit greenhouse gas emissions, saying current policy was insufficient, according to a report on climate change litigation by the United Nations Environment Program and the Sabin Center.

""I don't think it's the only way but certainly in the face of a hostile White House and a hostile Congress, the courts are an essential component of the fight,"" Gerrard said.

The Obama administration also opposed the lawsuit when it was filed in 2015.

The three years of waiting have worn on some of the 21 youth plaintiffs in the suit.

The oldest is now 22 years old, and seven are in college, a spokeswoman for Our Children's Trust said.

They've watched the world change, too.

For Levi, climate change is an existential threat to his home. He told CNN by phone that he recently saw a map posted at his swim team's pool that showed what the coastline would look like after decades of rising seas. His hometown, Satellite Beach, Florida, wasn't even on the map, he said.

""I just kinda thought, 'Oh crap, this is actually happening,'"" he said.

Jayden Foytlin, a teenager from Louisiana, watched her home flood in 2016 in a storm that scientists linked to human-induced global warming. ""I don't want to see another family go through what we are experiencing,"" she said after a court hearing in 2016 , glasses slipping off the end of her nose. Several people died in the floods near Baton Rouge. ""Nobody should have to bury their loved ones simply because the government wants to bury their heads from the truth or because oil companies want to bury themselves in money,"" she said.

The kids have watched the science get scarier. A landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report this fall said the world only has about a decade to avert catastrophic climate change . Already humans have contributed to warming the planet 1 degree Celsius, primarily by burning fossil fuels and clearing forests. And they've watched federal policy move away from addressing these existential challenges. In 2015, the United States supported the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which aims to avert disastrous warming. Now, President Donald Trump has pledged to pull the United States out of that international agreement, saying it "" unfairly punishes the United States"" and would result in ""draconian financial and economic burdens "" for the country. His administration, which has at times denied the scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming primarily by burning fossil fuels, also is trying to repeal Obama-era policies like the Clean Power Plan, which aim to limit pollution.

""My generation hasn't even been on this planet for more than two decades but now we're expected to carry the burden"" of problems inherited from older generations, said Nathan Baring , a teenager from Alaska, at the plaintiffs' rally in Oregon on Monday.

Julia Olson, chief legal counsel for Our Children's Trust, told CNN there is no logical venue to refile a case like this if it is thrown out entirely. ""This is the lawsuit. This is it. And it has to be heard,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""But if the system denies these young people the right to be heard in the court of law then we will create another forum to do this -- whether it's outside on the courthouse steps, or another venue. We will do this. It's such an important story.""

Federal officials have known for decades that burning fossil fuels would contribute to a dangerous climatic system -- yet they continued to encourage their production, she said.

""I think the government doesn't want that information to see the light of day,"" Olson said.

Olson believes the case will move forward.

So does Levi, the 11-year-old surfer from Florida.

"New concerns about sesame allergies","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181011191957-01-mcdonalds-burger-file-super-tease.jpg","Story highlights The FDA is looking into requiring allergy labels for sesame

Studies have identified an increase in the number of people with sesame allergies

 Sesame could become the newest allergen added to the list of foods required to be named on labels, US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb announced Monday.

Eight major food allergens must currently be declared on US labeling using their common names: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans.

These foods accounted for over 90% of documented serious food allergies in the country when the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act , which required the clear labeling of ingredients, was passed in 2004.

The FDA cites the undeclared presence of allergens as one of the leading reasons for food recalls and a public health issue.

""Unfortunately, we're beginning to see evidence that sesame allergies may be a growing concern in the US,"" Gottlieb said. ""A handful of studies, for example, suggest that the prevalence of sesame allergies in the US is more than 0.1 percent, on par with allergies to soy and fish.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 08:39:29 GMT"

"Doctors release new recommendations to reduce gun violence","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181028060117-squirrel-hill-vigil-super-tease.jpg"," A wave of hate-filled gun violence has swept the United States in the past few days, and now a physicians' group is releasing new recommendations to reduce firearm injuries and deaths nationwide.

On Saturday morning, a man sprayed bullets into a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 people who were attending services , law enforcement said. Federal prosecutors have filed hate crime charges against a suspect.

Another man is accused of shooting and killing two African-Americans on Wednesday at a grocery store in Kentucky in what is being investigated as a hate crime . The incident came moments after he tried to enter a predominantly black church nearby, police said.

On Monday, the American College of Physicians released new recommendations on how doctors can play a role in reducing gun violence across the country. The recommendations, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, had been planned for release before the recent wave of violence.

Those recommendations urge doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety.

The recent shootings emphasize ""how important and poignant it is for there to be policies that can be really effective in keeping guns away from both those who are either a risk to themselves or to others,"" said Dr. Ana MarÃ­a LÃ³pez, president of the American College of Physicians

""Firearm-related injuries and deaths really continue to be a part of what is harmful to patients and families,"" she said. ""Gun violence remains an issue in our country, unfortunately, and if this paper can help move hearts and minds to action to prevent these tragedies from happening, that would be a great achievement.""

Where physicians stand on gun policies

The American College of Physicians , a community of internal medicine specialists and subspecialists, says it's the largest medical specialty organization in the United States and has members in more than 145 countries worldwide.

The group has pressed Congress and state lawmakers for the adoption of policies to reduce firearm-related deaths and injuries for more than 20 years, according to the new paper.

The paper builds on and expands policies that the American College of Physicians approved in 2014 , calling for a public health approach to preventing firearm injuries and deaths.

Now, some new or revised policy positions include the college supporting ""appropriate regulation of the purchase of legal firearms to reduce firearms-related injuries and deaths"" and child access prevention laws that hold firearm owners accountable for the safe storage of firearms.

The paper also noted how the group supports the enactment of extreme risk protection order laws, which allow families and law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from individuals who may be a risk to themselves or others.

Indiana, California, Such laws -- variously known as ERPOs, gun violence restraining orders and "" red-flag laws "" -- are in effect in Connecticut Washington and, most recently, Oregon

Also, the college favors the enactment of legislation to ban the manufacture, sale, transfer and ownership of rapid-killing semiautomatic firearms for civilian use that are designed to have increased rapid-killing capacity and large-capacity magazines, along with retaining the current ban on automatic weapons for civilian use.

""Although there is more to learn about the causes of firearm violence and the best methods to prevent it, the available data support the need for a multifaceted and comprehensive approach to reducing firearm violence that is consistent with the Second Amendment,"" the authors wrote.

The National Rifle Association has not responded to a request for comment on the paper.

Last year, after the deadly mass shooting at a concert in Las Vegas , the NRA issued a statement noting in part that it ""believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations. In an increasingly dangerous world, the NRA remains focused on our mission: strengthening Americans' Second Amendment freedom to defend themselves, their families and their communities.""

The new American College of Physicians position paper reinforced the importance of doctors speaking to their patients about gun safety, especially as it relates to mental health, domestic violence and children.

A separate research letter published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics on Monday said that charges associated with emergency department visits for gun-related injuries among children younger than 18 amount to an average of $270 million per year in the United States.

""We speak with our patients about, 'do you use a seat belt?' If they ride a bike or ride a motorbike, 'do you use a helmet?' So these are public health issues, and it's similar to ask patients if there's a gun in the home,"" LÃ³pez said.

Even doctors might misjudge gun death frequency

Another study published in Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday finds that many adults in the US -- including health care professionals -- misperceive the frequency of gun-related deaths.

That study involved surveying 3,811 respondents about the frequency of deaths in their state that were by firearm homicide, firearm suicide or other methods. The researchers compared survey responses with data on violent deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's web-based injury statistics query and reporting system.

The data showed that, between 2014 and 2015, more suicides than homicides occurred in every state, and suicide by firearm was the most frequent cause of violent death in 29 states.

Yet the researchers found that only 13.5% of the adults surveyed correctly identified the most frequent cause of violent death in their state. Additionally, only 20% of health care professionals answered correctly.

For violent deaths involving firearms specifically, 25.9% of respondents correctly identified the most frequent intent, the researchers found.

""Our findings suggest that correcting misperceptions about the relative frequency of firearm-related violent deaths may make persons more cognizant of the actuarial risks to themselves and their family, thus creating new opportunities for prevention,"" the researchers wrote.

'An enormous public health problem'

When talking to patients about guns, ""the chief difficulties doctors face are the ones they bring themselves: They are not necessarily sufficiently informed about the topic or how to proceed with discussions of firearms,"" said Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency medicine physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis , who was not involved in the study or the new position paper.

""Our group and others are developing resources to help,"" said Wintemute, who with his colleagues has developed educational handouts with firearm safety strategies for patients and health care providers.

""Patients are generally quite willing to have conversations with physicians about firearms, when the patients see the conversations as relevant and understand the position is well-informed. In this way, discussing firearms is no different from discussing other sensitive topics,"" he said. ""I talk with patients about firearms almost every shift I work as an emergency physician.""

As for the American College of Physicians' new paper, Wintemute said that it was ""carefully thought through"" and that the recommendations are in line with scientific evidence.

""It shows a continuing willingness on the part of the American College of Physicians to exercise leadership in an area where physicians have traditionally been less involved than they should be,"" he said.

The paper represented one of the ways to address America's gun violence problem by ""focusing on the agent of injury, which is a firearm,"" said David Hemenway, professor of health policy and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health , who was not involved in the position paper.

""The evidence is overwhelming that firearm violence in the United States -- firearms killing people, scaring people, injuring people -- is an enormous public health problem,"" he said.

A 2015 data visualization by Martin Grandjean, a researcher at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, indicates that more Americans have died by guns in the United States since 1968, including suicide deaths, than by combat in all of the wars in American history.

""More Americans have been killed from guns in the United States since I graduated from college than have been killed on all the battlefields in all the wars in US history, including all the Americans in the Civil War and World War II and so forth,"" Hemenway said.

"CDC's handling of polio-like illness criticized by its own advisers","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181029041659-cdc-afm-1-super-tease.jpg","Albany, Oregon  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's own medical advisers are criticizing the federal health agency for being slow to respond to a polio-like disease that's struck hundreds of children over the past six years.

""Frustrated and disappointed -- I think that's exactly how most of us feel,"" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, one of the CDC advisers on AFM and an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine.

Van Haren and other doctors who care for these children say the agency has been slow to gather data and to guide pediatricians and emergency room physicians on how to diagnose and treat the children struck with the disease, acute flaccid myelitis.

""This is the CDC's job. This is what they're supposed to do well. And it's a source of frustration to many of us that they're apparently not doing these things,"" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, a professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another adviser to the CDC on AFM.

At a press briefing this month, a CDC doctor said the agency was working hard to find the cause of the outbreaks.

""We continue to investigate to better understand the clinical picture of AFM cases, risk factors and possible causes of the increase in cases,"" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

She said the agency could do a better job getting the message out about the signs of AFM.

""We're obviously not doing a good enough job because it's not getting to every place that we want it to, so we need to work harder,"" she told CNN in an interview.

According to the CDC , since 2014, there have been 396 confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis, which resembles polio and causes paralysis in children.

This year, there have been 72 confirmed cases of AFM, and another 119 possible cases are being investigated, according to the agency.

'They need to get busy'

The doctors aren't the only ones who are critical of the CDC's handling of the devastating disease.

On Saturday, five families whose children have AFM gathered at the home of 10-year-old McKenzie Andersen in Albany, Oregon, to celebrate an early Halloween. On the actual holiday, McKenzie will be having surgery related to a complication of the disease.

McKenzie Andersen and Bailey Sheehan.

McKenzie was a happy, healthy, hip-hop-dancing first-grader when she developed pneumonia in 2014. Within four days, she was paralyzed below the neck.

Today, she can move only her left hand and her feet and toes. She spends nearly all her time in bed, a ventilator breathing for her.

As the families munched on Halloween treats at McKenzie's home, they talked about their disappointment in the CDC. The mothers say the federal agency should be doing a better job letting emergency rooms know about the signs of AFM.

The women, who help run a Facebook group for hundreds of parents whose children have the disease, say that even today, six years after the first set of cases, emergency rooms still frequently send children home when they have signs of AFM, attributing the paralysis to a pinched nerve or some other cause.

Cambria Tate.

LeMay Axton said it happened to her granddaughter, Cambria Tate, when she was 2 years old. Now 4, she gets around in a wheelchair, or by scooting around on the floor.

She said she'll always wonder whether Cambria would have more mobility if her AFM had been caught sooner. She wonders why it wasn't, given that Cambria got sick in 2016, four years after the first cluster of cases of AFM.

""When I look back it now, I think to myself, 'why didn't they know? Why didn't they realize? Why didn't they catch something like that?' "" she said.

She said the CDC should be reaching out to hospitals with specific instructions about the signs of AFM, such as weak limbs and a drooping face, and what to do about it.

""Come on, it's 2018. They need to get busy,"" she said.

Although the CDC hasn't reached out to hospitals directly about AFM, it has reached out to state health departments and other agencies.

In 2014, in 2016 and again this year, the CDC provided state health departments with an example of a letter they could send to health care providers describing the symptoms of AFM.

The federal agency also sent information about AFM to more than 6,000 professionals at local, state and federal agencies. State employees were also given directions on how to send laboratory specimens to the CDC for testing.

The parents in the Facebook group also criticized the CDC for being out of touch with them and other families affected by AFM.

The parents say they've gathered data on hundreds of children with the disease and have offered to share it with the CDC, but when they've reached out to the agency, they receive a form letter thanking them for their interest.

Messonnier, the CDC doctor, said parents' voices are ""really important.""

""For other diseases that I work on, we definitely engage directly with the advocacy groups,"" she said. ""I guess I didn't know about this particular Facebook group.""

Scientific disputes

CNN interviewed four doctors who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM who shared the mothers' concerns and have several other concerns of their own.

The physicians want it to be required that cases of AFM be reported to the CDC, as is required for many other illnesses.

""To get to the bottom of causation, we've got to start with a simple accounting of how many cases there are,"" said Dr. Benjamin Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. ""We don't know how many cases are out there, and that's just wrong.""

Messonnier said that such required reporting is being considered but that the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists makes that decision, not the CDC.

Twice, once in 2015 and once in 2017 , that group decided that AFM did not need to be nationally reported. The CDC concurred.

The CDC advisers interviewed by CNN say the agency has been slow to narrow in on enterovirus as the most likely culprit for AFM and instead has continued to seriously consider other causes.

""This is a mystery so far, and we haven't solved it yet, so we have to be thinking broadly,"" Messonnier said at the press briefing this month.

But the four medical advisers said it's reasonable to focus in on enteroviruses. First, the clusters of cases have occurred during enterovirus season, which is late summer and fall. Second, many of the children had symptoms of an enterovirus infection. Third, many patients have tested positive for an enterovirus, and these advisers think more patients had the virus but weren't tested for it, or the test was done too late to pick it up. Fourth, when scientists infect mice with a particular enterovirus, the animals developed paralysis.

If the CDC focused on enteroviruses, it could lead more quickly to a treatment or a vaccine, according to the medical advisers interviewed by CNN.

""The CDC really seems to be out of sync with the conclusions that most scientists are coming to. We feel like we're not being listened to,"" said Van Haren, the Stanford researcher. ""We don't understand how the CDC has arrived at the place where they're at.""

Messonnier said that although enteroviruses can cause AFM, it's not clear that they're conclusively the main culprit. What gives doubt, she said, is that the virus has not been found in patients' cerebrospinal fluid.

""AFM is a destructive disease of the neurological system. If this virus was causing this damage, we'd expect to be able to find the virus in the spinal fluid of most of these patients, and we're not,"" she told CNN. ""We cannot explain these three peaks of disease in [2014, 2016 and 2018] by enterovirus, and so the way that sort of any discriminating scientist would do, we're trying to think more broadly and make sure that we're not missing something.""

according to the Butaccording to the CDC , the detection of poliovirus in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients is ""uncommon."" The doctors interviewed by CNN think enterovirus might follow that same pattern.

The CDC advisers also said they wished the agency were doing more to coordinate efforts around the country to find the best treatment for children with AFM. While some hospitals share their treatment outcomes with one another, there's no systematic, national method for doing so.

""We're trying to systematically collect our data so we can get smarter over time,"" said Greenberg, the pediatric neurologist in Dallas. ""We're looking for public health officials to help us out here.""

The CDC plans to meet next week with medical experts to discuss treatment considerations, Messonnier said.

The agency's medical advisers say they hope the meeting will bring about change.

The four advising doctors said they hope the CDC will make changes soon, including the encouragement of mandatory reporting, recognition that enterovirus is the likely cause of AFM and better collection of data.

""Physicians are on the front line, and what we're seeing is really heartbreaking: Children are healthy one day and really profoundly disabled in some cases the next,"" Van Haren said. ""That's what frustrates and disappoints and saddens so many of us.""","Tue, 30 Oct 2018 18:29:49 GMT"

"Vaccine and drug hope for infection killing 1.6 million each year","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131220073501-tuberculosis-tb-super-tease.jpg"," It's been around for centuries and has been curable for decades, but the bacteria behind tuberculosis are still the biggest infectious killers across the planet -- killing more people annually than HIV.

Last year, an estimated 10 million people developed tuberculosis, with 1.6 million dying from it, according to the World Health Organization , despite an effective treatment. Access to diagnosis and treatment is challenging, particularly in more deprived communities, and over the years, incomplete treatment courses have fueled the rise of resistance.

Rates of new infections have been falling each year, but at a pitiful rate -- just 2% per year -- and experts in the field began to feel hopeless, drained and fed up by what should so easily be beaten.

That is until a special trial, beaming the number ""54,"" woke them from resignation and gave the first signs of hope in years.

The number stood for a percentage -- 54%. It meant that a tuberculosis vaccine that crosses a coveted efficacy threshold may soon be possible -- and effective.

The vaccine, known as M72/AS01E , has been developed by GlaxoSmithKline and is the first vaccine of many recent attempts to show more than 50% protection against people developing TB, as published in the New England Journal of Medicine . Although the desire is 100% protection, experts believe more than half is enough efficacy to have a significant impact on new infections, possibly saving millions of lives and preventing 10s of millions of cases.

""I can't tell you the excitement,"" said Paula Fujiwara, scientific director at the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, also known as the Union.

""This is a hopeful place,"" she told CNN during the Union's 49th annual conference this week, in the Hague, Netherlands, where this and many other prevention options are being presented. ""This could really help millions of people.""

Many countries have had routine Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin vaccinations, known as BCG, for tuberculosis for decades. Many adults received them as teens, for example in the UK, and now babies living in high-risk populations receive them as newborns. The vaccine is not generally recommended for use in the United States because of low risk of infection.

So why the desperation for a new vaccine? BCG has some deficiencies , made evident in recent years -- it's only really beneficial to very young children and its protection doesn't continue into your adult years.

""BCG has little impact on TB in adolescents and adults,"" said Thomas Ottenhoff, professor of immunology at Leiden University in the Netherlands, during a session on vaccines at the conference Tuesday. ""That's a problem because that's exactly when TB becomes highly contagious"" and infections then spread in crowded living conditions, he said.

With a quarter of the world's population infected with a latent form of TB that could one day become active, when you come in contact with this airborne disease, you're going to want some protection.

""We need to prevent people getting infected in the first place,"" said Fujiwara. ""Like the BCG intended.""

Hundreds of developments in the field of TB are being presented at the conference this week, but two stand out as exciting options that could have an impact soon -- first and foremost the ""game changer"" vaccine.

Not yet protective for all

GSK's new vaccine candidate has one major caveat: It's only protective in people who are already infected with TB.

This prospect may not make much sense, but TB is a complex disease and protecting people who are already infected is just as important because people are able to carry the bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for years -- possibly their entire lives -- without symptoms. Hence the billions latently infected worldwide, of which estimates show 10% will develop active TB.

While the infection is hidden, a person is not contagious, but a weakened immune system, for example by infections such as HIV, is all it takes to fire it up and activate the disease -- and enable people to spread it.

The new vaccine shows promise against this happening and its use on already-infected people proves its efficacy as a proof of concept, added Marie-Ange Demoitie, vaccine project leader for the development of vaccines against tuberculosis at GlaxoSmithKline.

The latest Phase 2b trial began in 2014 and took place in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia -- all high burden TB countries -- enrolling more than 3,500 participants, half of whom got the vaccine and the other half, a placebo. All participants were identified as being latently infected with TB bacteria, but had not developed the disease.

Two years later, a protection level of 54% was calculated and the vaccine shown to be safe to use.

""TB infected people can be protected,"" said Mark Hatherill, director of the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative. ""But lots of questions remain unanswered.""

The crucial question, Hatherill said, is whether uninfected people can get long-lasting protection.

In addition, a larger Phase 3 trial is now necessary among infected people and the vaccine's components need refining for even better efficacy, said Fujiwara, to further prove this vaccine's value and continue down the road to actual implementation in affected populations.

""You want to get it to the population,"" said Fujiwara.

Preventing infections in children

Another study presented at the conference Thursday showed remarkable success in preventing infections among children living with parents or adults who have active TB and using a shorter course of treatment than what is currently recommended under WHO guidelines.

""Children are at high risk in an adult-infected household,"" said ValÃ©rie Schwoebel, program manager for Francophone Africa at the Union, adding that very young children are at risk of more severe forms of the disease.

Current guidelines recommend at-risk children under the age of 5 take the anti-TB drug isoniazid as a prophylaxis every day for six months, but the latest WHO report states that just 23% of eligible children globally receive it. Fujiwara believes part of the problem is how long kids need to take it. ""It's a long time,"" she said.

A new study tested out the benefits of a shorter treatment -- three months -- and got promising results.

Schwoebel's team recruited more almost 2,000 at-risk children in four countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic and Benin. In the first three countries, children were given two drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, for three months, and the other country received the regular six month treatment.

Of participants who got either treatment regimen, just 5% were diagnosed with active TB over 18 months of follow-up. Both options were effective, but took half the time.

""This shows that preventing TB using a shorter regimen appears to be feasible,"" said Schwoebel, and as a result the intervention is already being scaled up and hopefully rolled out in these countries.

When it comes to adults, the greatest hope is a vaccine, but Fujiawara points out that efficacies around 54% mean they'll always have to be used in combination with other prevention measures, such as awareness and wearing masks where necessary.

But if this could all come together soon, millions of lives can be saved, said Fujiwara.""TB is an ancient disease and it is curable,"" she said. ""The fact that it hasn't been cured is a scandal.""","Thu, 25 Oct 2018 20:15:50 GMT"
